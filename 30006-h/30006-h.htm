<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all I&rsquo;ve got to say, then, is, you&rsquo;re a
very foolish woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen Robinson buttoned her long cloak
forcefully, and arose with a haughty air from the
rocking-chair where she had pointed her remarks for
the last half-hour by swaying noisily back and forth
and touching the toes of her new high-heeled shoes with
a click each time to the floor.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud said nothing. She stood at the front
window, looking out across the sodden lawn to the road
and the gray sky in the distance. She did not turn
around to face her arrogant sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;d like to know is what you do propose
to do, then, if you don&rsquo;t accept our offer and come to
live with us? Were you expecting to keep on living in
this great barn of a house?&rdquo; Ellen Robinson&rsquo;s voice
was loud and strident with a crude kind of pain. She
could not understand her sister, in fact, never had.
She had thought her proposition that Julia come to
live in her home and earn her board by looking after
the four children and being useful about the house was
most generous. She had admired the open-handedness
of Herbert, her husband, for suggesting it. Some
husbands wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted a poor relative about.
Of course Julia always had been a hard worker; and it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
would relieve Ellen, and make it possible for her to
go around with her husband more. It would save the
wages of a servant, too, for Julia had always been a
wonder at economy. It certainly was vexing to have
Julia act in this way, calmly putting aside the proposition
as if it were nothing and saying she hadn&rsquo;t decided
what she was going to do yet, for all the world as if
she were a millionaire!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Ellen. I haven&rsquo;t had time to think.
There have been so many things to think about since the
funeral I haven&rsquo;t got used yet to the idea that mother&rsquo;s
really gone.&rdquo; Julia&rsquo;s voice was quiet and controlled, in
sharp contrast with Ellen&rsquo;s high-pitched, nervous tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; snapped Ellen. &ldquo;When you do, you&rsquo;ll
go all to pieces, staying here alone in this great barn.
That&rsquo;s why I want you to decide now. I think you
ought to lock up and come home with me to-night.
I&rsquo;ve spent just as much time away from home as I can
spare the last three weeks, and I&rsquo;ve got to get back
to my house. I can&rsquo;t stay with you any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, Ellen. I quite understand that,&rdquo;
said Julia, turning around pleasantly. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t expected
you to stay. It isn&rsquo;t in the least necessary.
You know I&rsquo;m not at all afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t decent to leave you here alone, when
you&rsquo;ve got folks that can take care of you. What will
people think? It places us in an awfully awkward
position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will simply think that I have chosen to
remain in my own house, Ellen. I don&rsquo;t see anything
strange or indecent about that.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></div>
<p>Julia Cloud had turned about, and was facing her
sister calmly now. Her quiet voice seemed to irritate
Ellen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; she said sharply. &ldquo;How exceedingly
childish, letting yourself be ruled by whims,
when common sense must show you that you are
wrong. I wonder if you aren&rsquo;t ever going to be
a <i>woman</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen said this word &ldquo;woman&rdquo; as if her sister
had already passed into the antique class and ought to
realize it. It was one of the things that hurt Julia
Cloud to realize that she was growing old apparently
without the dignity that belonged to her years, for they
all talked to her yet as if she were a little child and
needed to be managed. She opened her lips to speak,
but thought better of it, and shut them again, turning
back to the window and the gray, sodden landscape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as I said before, you&rsquo;re a very foolish
woman; and you&rsquo;ll soon find it out. I shall have to
go and leave you to the consequences of your folly.
I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what Herbert will say when he
finds out how you&rsquo;ve scorned his kindness. It isn&rsquo;t
every brother-in-law would offer&ndash;&ndash;yes, <i>offer</i>, Julia, for
I never even suggested it&ndash;&ndash;to take on extra expense in
his family. But you won&rsquo;t see your ingratitude if I
stand here and talk till doomsday; so I&rsquo;m going back
to my children. If you come to your senses, you can
ride out with Boyce Bains to-morrow afternoon.
Good-by, and I&rsquo;m sure I hope you won&rsquo;t regret this all
your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia walked to the door with her sister, and stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
watching her sadly while she climbed into her smart
little Ford and skillfully steered it out of the yard and
down the road. The very set of her shoulders as she
sailed away toward home was disapproving.</p>
<p>With a sigh of relief Julia Cloud shut the door and
went back to her window and the dreary landscape. It
was time for a sunset, but the sky was leaden. There
Would be nothing but grayness to look at, grayness in
front of her, grayness behind in the dim, silent room.
It was like her life, her long, gray life, behind and
ahead. All her life she had had to serve, and see others
happy. First as a child, the oldest child. There had
been the other children, three brothers and Ellen. She
had brought them all up, as it were, for the mother
had always been delicate and ailing. She had washed
their faces, kissed their bruises, and taken them to
school. She had watched their love-affairs and sent
them out into the world one by one. Two of the
brothers had come home to die, and she had nursed
them through long months. The third brother married
a wealthy girl in California, and never came home again
except on flying visits. He was dead now, too, killed
in action in France during the first year of the Great
War. Then her father had been thrown from his
horse and killed; and she had borne the burden for
her mother, settled up the estate, and made both ends
meet somehow, taking upon herself the burden of the
mother, now a chronic invalid. From time to time
her young nieces and nephews had been thrust upon
her to care for in some home stress, and always she had
done her duty by them all through long days of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
mischief and long nights of illness. She had done it
cheerfully and patiently, and had never complained even
to herself. Always there had been so much to be done
that there had been no time to think how the years
were going by, her youth passing from her forever
without even a glimpse of the rose-color that she supposed
was meant to come into every life for at least a
little while.</p>
<p>She hadn&rsquo;t realized it fully, she had been so busy.
But now, with the last service over, an empty house
about her, an empty heart within her, she was looking
with startled eyes into the future and facing facts.</p>
<p>It was Ellen&rsquo;s attempt to saddle her with a new
responsibility and fit her out to drudge on to the end
of her days that had suddenly brought the whole
thing out in its true light. She was tired. Too tired
to begin all over again and raise those children for
Ellen. They were nice, healthy children and well behaved;
but they were Ellen&rsquo;s children, and always
would be. If she went out to live with the Robinsons,
she would be Ellen&rsquo;s handmaid, at her beck and call,
always feeling that she must do whatever she was
asked, whether she was able or not, because she was a
dependent. Never anything for love. Oh, Ellen loved
her in a way, of course, and she loved Ellen; but they
had never understood each other, and Ellen&rsquo;s children
had been brought up to laugh and joke at her expense
as if she were somehow mentally lacking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Aunt <i>Ju</i>lia!&rdquo; they would say in a tone of
pity and scorn, as if she were too ignorant to understand
even their sneers.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>Perhaps it was pride, but Julia Cloud felt she would
rather die than face a future like that. It was respectable,
of course, and entirely reliable. She would be
fed and clothed, and nursed when she was ill. She
would be buried respectably when she died, and the
neighbors would say the Robinsons had been kind and
done the right thing by her; but Julia Cloud shuddered
as she looked down the long, dull vista of that future
which was offered her, and drew back for the first
time in her life. Not that she had anything better in
view, only that she shrank from taking the step that
would bring inevitable and irrevocable grayness to the
end of her days. She was not above cooking and
nursing and toiling forever if there were independence
to be had. She would have given her life if love beckoned
her. She would have gone to France as a nurse
in a moment if she had not been needed at her mother&rsquo;s
bedside. Little children drew her powerfully, but to
be a drudge for children who did not love her, in a
home where love was the only condition that would
make dependence possible, looked intolerable.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud had loved everybody that would let
her, and had received very little love in return. Back
in the years when she was twelve and went to school
a boy of fifteen or sixteen had been her comrade and
companion. They had played together whenever Julia
had time to play, and had roamed the woods and waded
the creeks in company. Then his people moved away,
and he had kissed her good-by and told her that some
day he was coming back to get her. It was a childish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
affection, but it was the only kiss of that kind she
had to remember.</p>
<p>The boy had written to her for a whole year, when
one day there came a letter from his grandmother telling
how he was drowned in saving the life of a little
child; and Julia Cloud had put the memory of that kiss
away as the only bright thing in her life that belonged
wholly to herself, and plodded patiently on. The tears
that she shed in secret were never allowed to trouble
her family, and gradually the pain had grown into a
great calm. No one ever came her way to touch her
heart again. Only little children brought the wistful
look to her eyes, and a wonder whether people had it
made up to them in heaven when they had failed of
the natural things of this life.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud was not one to pity herself. She was
sane, healthy, and not naturally morbid; but to-night,
for some reason, the gray sky, and the gray, sodden
earth, and the gray road of the future had got her
in their clutches, and she could not get away from them.
With straining eyes she searched the little bit of west
between the orchard tree that always showed a sunset
if there was one; but no streak of orange, rose, or
gold broke the sullen clouds.</p>
<p>Well, what was she going to do, anyway? Ellen&rsquo;s
question seemed to ring on stridently in her ears; she
tried to face it looking down the gray road into the
gray sky.</p>
<p>She had the house, but there were taxes to pay, and
there would be repairs every little while to eat up the
infinitesimal income which was left her, when all the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
expenses of her mother&rsquo;s long illness and death were
paid. They had been spending their principal. It could
not have been helped. In all, she knew, she had something
like two hundred dollars a year remaining. Not
enough to board her if she tried to board anywhere, to
say nothing of clothing. All this had been fully and exhaustively
commented upon by Ellen Robinson during
the afternoon.</p>
<p>The house might be rented, of course&ndash;&ndash;though it
was too antiquated and shabby-looking to bring much&ndash;&ndash;if
Julia was not &ldquo;so ridiculously sentimental about it.&rdquo;
Julia had really very little sentiment connected with
the house, but Ellen had chosen to think she had; so
it amounted to the same thing as far as the argument
went. Julia knew in her own heart that the only thing
that held her to the dreary old house with its sad
memories and its haunting emptiness was the fact that
it was hers and that here she could be independent and
do as she pleased. If she pleased to starve, no one
else need know it. The big ache that was in her heart
was the fact that there was nobody really to care if she
did starve. Even Ellen&rsquo;s solicitations were largely from
duty and a fear of what the neighbors would say if
she did not look after her sister.</p>
<p>Julia was lonely and idle for the first time in her
busy, dull life, and her heart had just discovered its
love-hunger, and was crying out in desolation. She
wanted something to love and be loved by. She missed
even the peevish, childish invalid whose last five years
had been little else than a living death, with a mind so
vague and hazy as seldom to know the faithful daughter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
who cared for her night and day. She missed the heart
and soul out of life, the bit of color that would glorify
all living and make it beautiful.</p>
<p>Well, to come back to sordid things, what was
there that she could do to eke out her pitiful little living?
For live she must, since she was here in this
bleak world and it seemed to be expected of her. Keep
boarders? Yes, if there were any to keep; but in this
town there were few who boarded. There was nothing
to draw strangers, and the old inhabitants mostly
owned their own houses.</p>
<p>She could sew, but there were already more sewing
women in the community than could be supported by
the work there was to be done, for most of the women
in Sterling did their own sewing. There were two
things which she knew she could do well, which everybody
knew she could do, and for which she knew Ellen
was anxious to have her services. She was the best
nurse in town and a fine cook. But again the women of
Sterling, most of them, did their own cooking, and
there was comparatively little nursing where a trained
nurse would not be hired. In short, the few things she
could do were not in demand in this neighborhood.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she knew in her heart that she intended
trying to live by her own meagre efforts, going
out for a few days nursing, or to care for some children
while their mothers went out to dinner or to the city,
to the theatre or shopping. There would be but little of
that, but perhaps by and by she could manage to make it
the fashion.</p>
<p>As she looked into the future, she saw herself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
trudging gloomily down the sunset way into a leaden
sky, caring for the Brown twins all day while their
mother was shopping; while they slept, mending stockings
out of the big round basket that Mrs. Brown
always kept by her sewing-chair; coming home at
night to a cheerless house and a solitary meal for which
she had no appetite; getting up in the night to go to
Grandma Fergus taken down suddenly with one of
her attacks; helping Mrs. Smith out with her sewing
and spring cleaning. Menial, monotonous tasks many
of them. Not that she minded that, if they only got
somewhere and gave her something from life besides
the mere fighting for existence.</p>
<p>She looked clear down to the end of her loveless
life, and saw the neighbors coming virtuously to perform
the last rites, and wondered why it all had to be.
She was unaware of all her years of sacrifice, glorious
patience, loving toil. Her life seemed to have been
so without point, so useless heretofore; and all that
could yet be, how useless and dreary it looked! Her
spirit was at its lowest ebb. Her soul was weary unto
death. She looked vainly for a break in that solid
wall of cloud at the end of the road, and looked so
hard that the tears came and fell plashing on the
window-seat and on her thin, tired hands. It was
because of the tears that she did not see the boy on a
bicycle coming down the road, until he vaulted off
at the front gate, left his wheel by the curb, and came
whistling up the path, pulling a little book and pencil
out of his pocket in a business-like way.</p>
<p>With a start she brushed the tears away, pushed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
back the gray hair from her forehead, and made ready
to go to the door. It was Johnny Knox, the little boy
from the telegraph office. He had made a mistake, of
course. There would be no telegram for her. It
would likely be for the Cramers next door. Johnny
Knox had not been long in the village, and did not know.</p>
<p>But Johnny did know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telegram for Miss Julia Cloud!&rdquo; he announced
smartly, flourishing the yellow envelope at her and
putting the pencil in her hand. &ldquo;Sign &rsquo;ere!&rdquo; indicating
a line in the book.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud looked hard at the envelope. Yes, there
was her name, though it was against all reason. She
could not think of a disaster in life of which it might
possibly be the forerunner. Telegrams of course meant
death or trouble. They had never brought anything
else to her.</p>
<p>She signed her name with a vague wonder that there
was nothing to pay. There had been so many things
to pay during the last two painful weeks, and her little
funds were almost gone.</p>
<p>She stood with the telegram in her hand, watching
the boy go whistling back to his wheel and riding off
with a careless whirl out into the evening. His whistle
lingered far behind, and her ears strained to hear it.
Now if a whistle like that were coming home to her!
Some one who would be glad to see her and want something
she could do for him! Why, even little snub-nosed,
impudent Johnny Knox would be a comfort if
he were all her own. Her arms suddenly felt empty
and her hands idle because there was nothing left for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
her to do. Involuntarily she stretched them out to the
gray dusk with a wistful motion. Then she turned,
and went back to the window to read her telegram.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Dear Cloudy Jewel</span>: Leslie and I are on our
way East for a visit, and will stop over Wednesday
night to see you. Please make us some caraway cookies
if not too much trouble.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;Your loving nephew,<span class='rindent6'>&nbsp;</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Allison Cloud</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A glad smile crept into Julia Cloud&rsquo;s lonely eyes.
Leslie and Allison were her California brother&rsquo;s children,
who had spent three happy months with her when
they were five and seven while their father and mother
went abroad. &ldquo;Cloudy Jewel&rdquo; was the pet name they
had made up for her. That was twelve long years ago,
and they had not forgotten! They were coming to see
her, and wanted some caraway cookies! A glad light
leaped into her face, and she lifted her eyes to the
gray distance. Lo! the leaden clouds had broken and a
streak of pale golden-rose was glowing through the
bars of gray.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p>Leslie and Allison!</p>
<p>Julia Cloud stood gazing out into the west,
while the whole sky lightened and sank away
into dusk with a burning ruby on its breast. The gloom
of her spirit glowed into brightness, and joy flooded
her soul.</p>
<p>Leslie and Allison! What round little warm bodies
they had, and what delicate, refined faces! They had
not seemed like Ellen&rsquo;s blowsy, obstreperous youngsters,
practical and grasping to the last extreme after
the model of their father. They had starry eyes and
hair like tangled sunbeams. Their laughter rippled
like brooks in summer, and their hands were like bands
that bound the heart. Cookies and stories and long
walks and picnics! Those had made up the beautiful
days that they spent with her, roaming the woods and
meadows, picking dandelions and violets, and playing
fairy stories. It had been like a brief return of her old
childish days with her boy comrade. She remembered
the heartache and the empty days after they had gone
back to their Western home, and the little printed
childish letters that came for a few months till she
was forgotten.</p>
<p>But not really forgotten, after all. For some link
of tenderness must still remain that they should think
of her now after all these years of separation, and want
to visit her. They remembered the cookies! She smiled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
reminiscently. What a batch of delectable cookies she
would make in the morning! Why, to-morrow would
be Wednesday! They would be here to-morrow night!
And there was a great deal to be done!</p>
<p>She turned from the belated sunset unregretting,
and hastened to begin her preparations. There were
the two front rooms up-stairs to be prepared. She
would open the windows at once, and let the air sweep
through all night. They had been shut up a long time,
for she had brought the invalid down-stairs to the little
sitting-room the last few months to save steps and
be always within hearing. The second story had been
practically unused except when Ellen or the children
were over for a day or two.</p>
<p>She hurried up-stairs, and lit the gas in the two
rooms, throwing wide the windows, hunting out fresh
sheets and counterpanes. She could dust and run the
carpet-sweeper over the rooms right away, and have
them in order; and that would save time for to-morrow.
Oh, it was good to have something cheerful to do once
more. Just supposing she had yielded&ndash;&ndash;as once that
afternoon she almost had&ndash;&ndash;to Ellen&rsquo;s persistent urgings,
and had gone home with her to-night! Why, the
telegram might not have reached her till after the children
had come, and found the house empty, and
gone again!</p>
<p>Julia bustled around happily, putting the rooms
into charming order, hunting up a little picture of the
child Samuel kneeling in the temple, that Allison used
to like, going to the bottom of an old hair trunk for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
rag doll she had made for Leslie to cuddle when she
went to sleep at night.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ambrose Perkins across the way looked uneasily
out of her bedroom window at half-past nine,
and said to her husband:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like Julia Cloud is staying up awful late to-night.
She&rsquo;s got a light in both front rooms, too.
There can&rsquo;t be company. I s&rsquo;pose Ellen and some of
her children have stayed down after all. Poor Ellen!
She told me she simply couldn&rsquo;t spare the time away
from home any longer, but Julia was set on staying
there. I never thought Julia was selfish; but I s&rsquo;pose
she doesn&rsquo;t realize how hard it is for Ellen, living that
way between two houses. Julia&rsquo;ll go to live with Ellen
now, of course. It&rsquo;s real good of Herbert Robinson
to ask her. Julia ought to appreciate having relatives
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relatives nothing!&rdquo; said Mr. Ambrose, pulling
off his coat and hanging it over a chair. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be a
fool if she goes! She&rsquo;s slaved all her life, and she
deserves a little rest now. If she goes out to Herbert
Robinson&rsquo;s, she won&rsquo;t be allowed to call her eyelashes
her own; you mark my words!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what else can she do?&rdquo; said his wife. &ldquo;She
hasn&rsquo;t any husband or children, and I think she&rsquo;ll be
mighty well off to get a good home. Men are awful
hard on each other, Ambrose. I always knew that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud meanwhile, with a last look at the
neat rooms, put out her lights, and went to bed, but not
to sleep. She was so excited that the darkness seemed
luminous about her. She was trying to think how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
those two children would look grown up. Allison was
nineteen and Leslie nearly seventeen now. Their
mother had been dead five years, and they had been
in boarding-schools. Their guardian was an old gentleman,
a friend of their mother&rsquo;s. That was about all
she knew concerning them. Would they seem like
strangers, she wondered, or would there be enough
resemblance to recall the dear girl and boy of the years
that were gone? How she clung to those cookies with
hope! There was some remembrance left, or they
would not have put cookies in a telegram. How impetuous
and just like Allison, the boy, that telegram
had sounded!</p>
<p>It was scarcely daylight when Julia Cloud arose
and went down to the kitchen to bake the cookies;
and the preparations she made for baking pies and
doughnuts and other toothsome dainties would lead
one to suppose that she was expecting to feed a regiment
for a week at least.</p>
<p>She filled the day with hard work, as she had
been wont to do, and never once thought of gray
sunsets or dreary futures. Not even the thought of
her sister Ellen came to trouble her as she put the
house in order, filled her pantry with good things to eat,
and set the table for three with all the best things the
house afforded.</p>
<p>At evening she stood once more beside the front
window, looking out sunsetward. There was nothing
gray about either sky or road or landscape now. There
had been brilliant sunshine all day long, and the sky
lay mellow and yellow behind the orchard, with a clear,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
transparent greenish-blue above and a hint of rosy
light in the long rays that reached their fingers along
the ground between the apple-trees. In a few minutes
the evening train would be in, and there would be rose
in the sunset. She knew the signs, and the sky would
be glorious to-night. They would see it as they came
from the train. In fifteen minutes it would be time
for her to put on her hat and go down to meet them!
How her heart throbbed with anticipation!</p>
<p>Forebodings came to shadow her brightness. Suppose
they should not come! Suppose they were delayed,
or had changed their minds and should send
another telegram saying so! She drew a deep breath,
and tried to brace herself for the shock of the thought.
She looked fearfully down the road for a possible
Johnny Knox speeding along with another telegram,
and was relieved to see only Ambrose Perkins ambling
home for supper followed by his tall, smiling Airedale.</p>
<p>There was a shadow, too, that stood behind her,
though she ignored it utterly; it was the thought of
the afterwards, when the two bright young things
had been and gone, and she would have to face the
gray in her life again without the rose. But that
would be afterwards, and this was now! Ten minutes
more, and she would go to the station!</p>
<p>At that minute a great blue automobile shot up
to the front gate, and stopped. A big lump flew
into Julia Cloud&rsquo;s throat, and her hand went to her
heart. Had it then come, that telegram, saying they
had changed their minds? She stood trembling by
the window, unable to move.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>But out from the front seat and the back as if
ejected from a catapult shot two figures, and flew together
up the front walk, a tall boy and a little girl,
just as the sun dropped low and swung a deep red light
into the sky, flooding the front yard with glory, and
staining the heavens far up into the blue.</p>
<p>They had come! They had come before it was yet
train-time!</p>
<p>Julia Cloud got herself to her front door in a
tremor of delight, and instantly four strong young
arms encircled her, and nearly smothered the life out
of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O you dear Cloudy Jewel! You look just the
same. I knew you would. Only your hair is white
and pretty,&rdquo; Leslie gurgled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, she is just the same! What did I tell
you?&rdquo; cried Allison, lifting them both and carrying
them inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, who on earth can that be?&rdquo; said Mrs.
Ambrose Perkins, flying to her parlor window at the
first sound of the automobile. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t any of them
folks from the city that were out to the funeral, for
there wasn&rsquo;t a car like that there, I&rsquo;m certain! I mean
to run over and borrow a spoonful of soda pretty soon,
just to find out. It couldn&rsquo;t be any of Tom&rsquo;s folks
from out West, for they couldn&rsquo;t come all that way in
a car. It must be some of her father&rsquo;s relations from
over in Maryland, though I never heard they were that
well off. A chauffeur in livery! The idea of all that
style coming to see Julia Cloud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we didn&rsquo;t come on the train,&rdquo; explained Leslie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
eagerly. &ldquo;We came in Allison&rsquo;s new car. Mr.
Luddington&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s our guardian&ndash;&ndash;was coming East,
and he said we might come with him. We&rsquo;ve been
dying to come for ages. And he&rsquo;d been promising
Allison he might get this new car; so we stopped in
the city and bought it, and Allison drove it down. Of
course Mr. Luddington made his man come along.
He wouldn&rsquo;t let us come alone. He&rsquo;s gone up to Boston
for three days; and, when he comes back, he&rsquo;s coming
down here to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie was talking as fast as an express train, and
Julia Cloud stood and admired her in wonder.</p>
<p>She was slim and delicately pretty as ever, with
the same mop of goldy-brown curls, done up in a knot
now and making her look quaintly like the little five-year-old
on a hot day with her curls twisted on the
top of her head for comfort. She wore a simple little
straight frock of some dark silk stuff, with beaded
pockets and marvellous pleats and belts and straps in
unexpected places, such as one sees in fashion-books,
but not on young girls in the town of Sterling; and her
hat was a queer little cap with a knob of bright beads,
wonderfully becoming, but quite different from anything
that Julia Cloud had ever seen before. Her movements
were darting and quick like a humming-bird&rsquo;s;
and she wore long soft su&egrave;de gloves and tiny high
su&egrave;de boots. The older woman watched her, fascinated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re sure we&rsquo;re not being an inconvenience,
dropping down upon you in this unexpected
way?&rdquo; asked Allison in a quite grown-up man&rsquo;s voice,
and looking so tall and handsome and responsible that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
Julia Cloud wanted to take him in her arms and hug
him to make sure he was the same little boy she used
to tuck into bed at night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So soon after Grandma&rsquo;s death, too,&rdquo; put in
Allison. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know, of course, till we got
about a mile from Sterling and stopped to ask the way
to the house, and a man told us about the funeral being
Monday. We weren&rsquo;t sure then but it would be an
intrusion. You see we left California about two weeks
ago, and none of our mail has reached us yet; so we
hadn&rsquo;t heard. You&rsquo;re sure we won&rsquo;t bother you a bit,
you dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their aunt assured them rapturously that their coming
was the most blessed thing that could have been
just at this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! then I&rsquo;m relieved,&rdquo; said Leslie, throwing off
her hat and dropping into the nearest chair. &ldquo;Allison,
tell that man to put the car somewhere in a garage and
get back to the city. They said there was a train back
about this time. The man who directed us told us so.
No, dear, he doesn&rsquo;t need any dinner. He&rsquo;s not used
to it till seven, and he&rsquo;ll be in the city by that time.
He&rsquo;s in a hurry to get back. Cookies? Well, yes, you
might give him a cooky or two if you&rsquo;re sure there&rsquo;ll
be enough left for us. I&rsquo;ve just dreamed of those
cookies all these years. I&rsquo;m so anxious to see if they&rsquo;ll
taste as they did when I was a child. May I come with
you and see if I remember where the cooky-jar is?
Oh, joy, Allison! Just look! A whole crock and a
platter full! Isn&rsquo;t this peachy? Allison, do hustle
up and get that man off so we can begin our visit!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>It was like having a couple of dolls suddenly come
alive and begin to talk.</p>
<p>They talked so fast and they took everything so
delightfully for granted that Julia Cloud was in a
tremble of joy. It seemed the most beautiful thing in
the world that these two strong, handsome, vivid young
things should have dropped into her life and taken her
into their hearts in this way as if she really belonged,
as if they loved her! She was too excited to talk. She
hardly knew what to do first. But they did not wait for
her initiative. Allison was off with his car and his
man, munching cookies as he went, and promising to
return in fifteen minutes hungry as a bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s go up-stairs, you dear Cloudy Jewel,
and I&rsquo;ll smooth my hair for dinner. I&rsquo;m crazy to see
if I remember things. There was a little red chair
that I used to sit in&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s here, in your room, dear, and the old rag
doll, Betsey; do you remember her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should say I did! Is Betsey alive yet?
Dear old Betsey! How ducky of you to have kept
her for me all these years! Oh, isn&rsquo;t it perfectly peachy
that we could come? That we&rsquo;re really here at last, and
you want us? You do, don&rsquo;t you, Cloudy, dear?
You&rsquo;re sure you do?&rdquo; Lesley&rsquo;s tone was anxious, and
her bright brown eyes studied the older woman&rsquo;s face
eagerly; but what she saw there was fully satisfactory,
for she smiled, and rattled joyfully on in the old
babbling-brook voice that reminded one so of years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not to tell you what we&rsquo;ve really come for till
Allison comes, because I&rsquo;ve promised; and anyway he&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
the man, and he wants to tell you himself; but it&rsquo;s the
dandiest reason, perfectly peachy! It&rsquo;s really a plan.
And say, Cloudy, dear, won&rsquo;t you promise me right
here and now that you will say &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; to what he asks
you if you possibly, <i>possibly</i> can?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud promised in a maze of delight.</p>
<p>She stood in hovering wonder, and watched the
mass of curls come down and go up again with the swift
manipulation of the slim white fingers, remembering
how she used to comb those tangled curls with the
plump little body leaning sturdily against her knee.
It seemed to be the first time since she was a child that
youth and beauty had come to linger before her.
All her experience had been of sickness and suffering
and death, not life and happiness.</p>
<p>There was stewed chicken and little biscuits with
gravy for supper. It was a dish the children used to
love. It was all dished up and everything ready when
Allison came back. He reported that the car was
housed but a block away, and the man had gone to his
train, tickled to death with his cookies. Allison was
so glad to be back that he had to take his aunt in
his arms again and give her a regular bear-hug till
she pleaded for mercy, but there was a happy light in
her eyes and a bright color in her cheeks when he
released her that made her a very good-looking aunt
indeed to sit down at the table with two such handsome
children.</p>
<p>Just at that moment Ellen Robinson in her own
home was pouring her husband&rsquo;s second cup of coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;d better take the car and run
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
down for Julia before dark?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think
she&rsquo;ll be about ready to come back with me by this time,
and I need her early in the morning if I&rsquo;m going to
begin cleaning house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better wait one more night,&rdquo; said Herbert stolidly.
&ldquo;Let her get her fill of staying alone nights. It&rsquo;ll do
her good. We don&rsquo;t want her to be high and mighty
when she gets here. I&rsquo;m boss here, and she&rsquo;s got to
understand that. She&rsquo;s so mighty independent, you
know, it&rsquo;s important she should find that out right at
the start. I&rsquo;m not going to have her get bossy with
these children, either. They aren&rsquo;t her children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four pairs of keen little Robinson eyes took in this
saying with quick intelligence, and four stolid sets of
shoulders straightened up importantly with four uplifted
saucy chins. They would store these remarks
away for future reference when the aunt in question
arrived on the scene. They would come in well, they
knew, for they had had experience with her in
times past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Jule ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to boss me,&rdquo; swaggered
the youngest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ner me, neither!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ner me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess she wouldn&rsquo;t <i>dast</i> try it on <i>me</i>!&rdquo; boasted
the eldest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t asked us what we came for,&rdquo; opened
up Allison as soon as everybody was served
with chicken, mashed potato, succotash, stewed
tomatoes, biscuits, pickles, and apple-sauce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you came for cookies,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud,
with a mischievous twinkle in her gray eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hung one on me, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Allison,
laughing. &ldquo;But that wasn&rsquo;t all. Guess again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you came to see me,&rdquo; she suggested shyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are! But that&rsquo;s not all, either. That
wouldn&rsquo;t last much longer than the cookies. Guess
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Julia Cloud, growing suddenly
stricken with the thought of their going. &ldquo;I
give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then I&rsquo;ll tell you. You see we&rsquo;ve come East
to college, both of us. Of course I&rsquo;ve had my freshman
year, but the Kid&rsquo;s just entering. We haven&rsquo;t
decided which college it&rsquo;s to be yet, but it&rsquo;s to be co-ed,
we know that much, because we&rsquo;re tired of being separated.
When one hasn&rsquo;t but two in the family and has
been apart for five years, one appreciates a home, I tell
you that. And so we&rsquo;ve decided we want a home.
We&rsquo;re not just going to college to live there in the
usual way; we&rsquo;re going to take a house, live like real
folks, and go to school every day. We want a fireplace
and a cooky-jar of our own; a place to bring our friends
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
and have good times. But most of all we want a
mother, and we&rsquo;ve come all this way to coax you to
come and live with us, play house, you know, as you
used to do down on the mossy rocks with broken bits
of china for dishes and acorns for cups and saucers.
Play house and you be mother. Will you do it, Cloudy
Jewel? It means a whole lot to us, and we&rsquo;ll try to
play fair and make you have a good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud put her hand on her heart, and lifted
her bewildered eyes to the boy&rsquo;s eager face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; she said wonderingly. &ldquo;You want <i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure do!&rdquo; said Allison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed we do, Cloudy, dear! That&rsquo;s just
what we do want!&rdquo; cried Leslie, jumping up and
running around to her aunt&rsquo;s chair to embrace her
excitedly. &ldquo;And you promised, you know, that you
would do what we wanted if you possibly, <i>possibly</i>
could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, we put it up to our guardian about the
house,&rdquo; went on Allison, &ldquo;and he said the difficulty
would be to get the right kind of a housekeeper that
he could trust us with. Of course he&rsquo;s way off in
California, and he has to be fussy. He&rsquo;s built that way.
But we told him we didn&rsquo;t want any housekeeper at all,
we wanted a mother. He said you couldn&rsquo;t pick
mothers off trees, but we told him we knew where
there was one if we could only get her. So he let
us come and ask; and, if you say you&rsquo;ll do it, he&rsquo;s coming
down to see you and fix it up about the money part.
He said you&rsquo;d have to have a regular salary or he
wouldn&rsquo;t consider it, because there were things he&rsquo;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
have to insist upon that he had promised mother; and,
if there wasn&rsquo;t a business arrangement about it, he
wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do. Besides, he said it was
worth a lot to run a couple of rough-necks like Les and
me, and he&rsquo;d make the salary all right so you could
afford to leave whatever you were doing and just
give your time to mothering us. Now it&rsquo;s up to you,
Cloudy Jewel, to help us out with our proposition or
spoil everything, because we simply won&rsquo;t have a housekeeper,
and we don&rsquo;t know another real mother in the
whole world that hasn&rsquo;t a family of her own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both left their delicious dinner, and got
around her, coaxing and wheedling exactly as if she
had already declined, when the truth was she was too
dazed with joy to open her lips, even if they had given
her opportunity to speak.</p>
<p>It was some time before the excitement quieted
down and they gave her a chance to say she would go.
Even then she spoke the words with fear and trembling
as one might step off a commonplace threshold
into a fairy palace, not sure but it might be stepping
into space.</p>
<p>Outside the sky was still flooded with after-sunset
glory, but there was so much glory in the hearts of
the three inside the dining-room that they never noticed
it at all. It might have been raining or hailing, and
they would not have known, they were so happy.</p>
<p>Both the guests donned long gingham aprons and
wiped the dishes when the meal was over, both talking
with all their might, recalling the days of their childhood
when they had had towels pinned around them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
and been allowed to dry the cups and pans; then suddenly
jumping ahead and planning what they would
do in the dear new home of the future. They were all
three as excited about it as if they had been a bridal
couple planning for their honeymoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall want five bedrooms,&rdquo; said Leslie decidedly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought that all out, one for each of
us and two guest-rooms, so we can have a boy and a
girl home for overnight with us as often as we want to.
And there simply must be a fireplace, or we won&rsquo;t
take the house. If there isn&rsquo;t the right kind of a house
in town, we&rsquo;ll choose some other college. There are
plenty of colleges, but you can have only one home,
and it must be the right kind. Then of course we want
a big kitchen where we can make fudge as often as we
choose in the evenings, and a dining-room with a bay-window,
with seats and flowers and a canary. Cloudy
Jewel, you don&rsquo;t mind cats, do you? I want two at
least. I&rsquo;ve been crazy for a kitten all the time I was
in school, and Al wants a big collie. You won&rsquo;t mind,
will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Julia Cloud discovered that latent in her
heart all these years there had also lain a desire for a
cat and a dog; and she lifted guilty eyes, and confessed
it. She felt a pang of remembrance as she recalled
how her mother used so often to tell her she was
nothing but an &ldquo;old child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps your guardian will not think me a proper
person to chaperon you,&rdquo; she suggested in sudden alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;d just better not!&rdquo; declared Allison,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
bristling up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know where he could find
a better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been in society,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud
thoughtfully. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know social ways much, and
I&rsquo;ve never been considered to have any dignity or
good judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just why we like you,&rdquo; chorused the children.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never grown up and got dull and stiff
and poky like most grown folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were so afraid,&rdquo; began Leslie, putting a loving
arm about her aunt&rsquo;s waist, &ldquo;that you would have
changed since we were children. We talked it all
over on the way here. We had a kind of eyebrow
code by which we could let each other know what we
thought about it without your seeing us. We were to
lift one eyebrow, the right one, if we were favorably
impressed, and draw down the left if we were
disappointed. But in case we were sure both eyebrows
were to go up. And of course we were sure you
were just the same dear the minute we laid eyes on you,
and all four of our eyebrows went high as they&rsquo;d go the
first instant. Didn&rsquo;t you notice Allison? His eyebrows
were almost up to his hair, and they pulled his
eyes so wide open they were perfectly round like
saucers. As for me I think mine went way up under
my hair. I&rsquo;m not sure if they&rsquo;ve got back to their
natural place even yet!&rdquo; And Leslie laid a rosy finger
over her brow, and felt anxiously along the delicate
velvety line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go out and telegraph Mr. Luddington that
you are willing,&rdquo; announced Allison as he hung up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
dish-towel. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get it in the morning when he
reaches Boston, and then he needn&rsquo;t fuss and fume any
longer about what he&rsquo;s going to do with us. Besides,
I like to have the bargain clinched somehow, and a
telegram will do it.&rdquo; Allison slammed out of the house
noisily to the extreme confusion of Mrs. Ambrose
Perkins, who hadn&rsquo;t been able to eat her supper properly
for watching the house to see what would happen
next. Who could that young man be?</p>
<p>She simply couldn&rsquo;t get a clew; for, when she went
over for the soda, though she knocked several times,
and heard voices up-stairs, and altogether unseemly
laughter for a house where there had just been a
funeral, not a soul came to the door! Could it be that
Julia Cloud heard her and stayed up-stairs on purpose?
She felt that as the nearest neighbor and a great friend,
of Ellen&rsquo;s it would be rather expected of her to find out
what was going on. She resolutely refrained from
lighting the parlor lamp, and took up her station at the
dark window to watch; but, although she sat there
until after ten o&rsquo;clock, she was utterly unable to find
out anything except that the household across the way
stayed up very late and there were lights in both front
rooms again. She felt that if nothing developed by
morning she would just have to get Ambrose to hitch,
up and drive out to Ellen&rsquo;s. Ellen ought to know.</p>
<p>But Julia Cloud was serenely unconscious of this
espionage. She had entered an Eden of bliss, and was
too happy to care about anything else.</p>
<p>Seated on the big old couch in the parlor with a
child on either side of her, a hand in each of hers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
often a head on each shoulder nestling down, they
talked. Planned and talked. Now the brother would
break in with some tale of his school-days; now the
sister would add a bit of reminiscence, just as if they
had been storing it all up to tell her. The joyous happiness
of them all seemed like heaven dropped down
to earth. It was as she had sometimes dreamed mothers
might talk with their own children. And God had
granted this unspeakable gift to her! Was it real?
Would it last? Or was she only dreaming? Once
it vaguely passed through her mind that she would
not be sure of the reality of the whole
thing until she had seen Ellen. If she could talk
with Ellen about it, tell her what she was going to
do, show her the children, and then come back and
find it all the same, it would last. But somehow she
shrank unspeakably from seeing Ellen. She could not
get away from the feeling that Ellen would dispel it
all; that someway, somehow, she would succeed in
breaking up all the bright plans and scattering them
like soap-bubbles in the wind.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was a very beautiful illusion, if
illusion it was; and one to be prolonged as late
as possible.</p>
<p>She was horrified when at last she heard the rebuking
strokes of the town clock, ten! eleven! <i>twelve!</i></p>
<p>She started to her feet ashamed.</p>
<p>And even then they would not let her go to bed
at once. She must turn out the lights, and sit in the
hall between their rooms as she did long ago, and tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
the story of &ldquo;The Little Rid Hin&rdquo; just as she had told
it night after night when they were children.</p>
<p>It was characteristic of the unfailing youth of the
woman that she entered into the play with zest. Attired
in a long kimono, with her beautiful white hair in two
long silver braids down over her shoulders, she sat in
the dark and told the story with the same vivid language;
and then she stole on tiptoe first to the sister&rsquo;s
bedside, to tuck her in and kiss her softly, and then
to the brother&rsquo;s; and at each bedside a young, strong
arm reached out and drew her face down, whispering
&ldquo;Good-night&rdquo; with a kiss and &ldquo;I love you, Cloudy
Jewel,&rdquo; in tender, thrilling tones.</p>
<p>The two big children were asleep at last, and Julia
Cloud stole to her own bed to lie in a tumult of wonder
and joy, and finally sink into a light slumber, wherein
she dreamed that she had fallen heir to a rose-garden,
and all the roses were alive and could talk; until Ellen
came driving up in her Ford and ran right over them,
crushing them down and cutting their heads off with a
long, sharp whip she carried that somehow turned
out to be made of words strung together with biting
sarcasm.</p>
<p>She awoke in the broad morning sunlight to find
both children done up in bath-robes and slippers, sitting
one each side of her on the bed, laughing at her and
tickling her chin with a feather from the seam of
the pillow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Cloudy Jewel, you&rsquo;ve just got to begin
to make plans!&rdquo; announced Leslie, curling up in a ball
at her feet and looking very business-like with her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
fluffy curls around her face like a golden fleece.
&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much time, and Guardy Lud will be down
upon us by to-morrow or the next day at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guardy Lud!&rdquo; exclaimed Julia Cloud bewildered.
&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our pet name for Mr. Luddington,&rdquo; explained
Leslie, wrinkling up her nose in a grin of merriment.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it cute? Wait till you see him, and
you&rsquo;ll see how it fits. He&rsquo;s round and bald with a
shiny red nose, and spectacles; and he doesn&rsquo;t mind
our kidding at all. He&rsquo;d have made a lovely father if
he wasn&rsquo;t married, but he has a horrid wife. We
don&rsquo;t like her at all. She&rsquo;s like a frilly piece of French
china with too much decoration; and she&rsquo;s always sick
and nervous; and she jumps, and says &lsquo;Oh, mercy!&rsquo;
every time we do the least little thing. She doesn&rsquo;t
like us any better than we like her. Her name is
Alida, and Allison says we&rsquo;re always trying to &lsquo;elude&rsquo;
her. The only good thing she ever did was to advise
Guardy Lud to let us come East to college. She wanted
to get us as far away from her as possible. And it certainly
was mutual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now, Leslie, you&rsquo;re chattering again,&rdquo;
broke in Allison, looking very tall and efficient in his
blue bath-robe. &ldquo;You said you would talk business,
and not bleat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so I am,&rdquo; pouted Leslie. &ldquo;I guess Cloudy
has got to understand about our family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now let&rsquo;s get down to business,&rdquo; said her
brother. &ldquo;Cloudy, what have you got to do before
you leave? You know it isn&rsquo;t very long before the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
colleges open, and we&rsquo;ve got to start out and hunt a
home right away. Do you have to pack up here
or anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; gasped Julia Cloud, looking
around half frightened. &ldquo;I suppose I ought to ask
Ellen. She will be very much opposed to anything
I do, but I suppose she ought to be told first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz! I don&rsquo;t see why Aunt Ellen has to butt
into our affairs. She&rsquo;s got her own home and family,
and she never did like us very much. I remember hearing
her tell Grandma that we were a regular nuisance,
and she would be glad when we were gone back
to California.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was because you hid behind the sofa when
Uncle Herbert was courting her, and kidded them,&rdquo;
giggled Leslie.</p>
<p>A stray little twinkle of a dimple peeped out by the
corner of Julia Cloud&rsquo;s mouth. It hadn&rsquo;t been out for
a number of years, and she knew she ought not to laugh
at such pranks now; but it was so funny to think of
Herbert Robinson being kidded in the midst of
his courting!</p>
<p>The dimple started the lights dancing in Leslie&rsquo;s
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! now you dear old Jewel, you know you
don&rsquo;t want to talk to Aunt Ellen about us. She&rsquo;ll just
mess things all up. Let&rsquo;s just <i>do</i> things, and get
&rsquo;em all fixed up, and then tell her when it&rsquo;s too late
for her to make a fuss,&rdquo; gurgled Leslie down close to
Julia&rsquo;s ear, finishing up with a delicious bear-hug.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose she&rsquo;ll be mortally offended,&rdquo; murmured
Julia Cloud in troubled hesitancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose she is; she&rsquo;ll get over it, won&rsquo;t
she?&rdquo; growled Allison. &ldquo;And anyhow you&rsquo;re old
enough to manage your own affairs, Cloudy Jewel. I
guess you&rsquo;re older than she is, aren&rsquo;t you? I guess
you&rsquo;ve got a right to do as you please, haven&rsquo;t you?
And you <i>do</i> want to go with us, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; His
voice was anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do, dear boy,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud eagerly;
&ldquo;but you know your guardian may not approve at all
when he sees what a foolish &lsquo;young&rsquo; aunt I am, allowing
you to sit up late and talk fairy stories all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They smothered her in kisses, compliments, and
assurances; and it was some time before the conversation
swung around again to the important subject of
the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to do anything to the house but
just shut it up, do you?&rdquo; asked Allison, looking
anxiously about in a helpless, mannish way. &ldquo;Because,
if you do, we ought to be getting to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man over at Harmony Village that
wanted to rent a house here,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud thoughtfully.
&ldquo;I might write a letter to him. I don&rsquo;t know
whether he&rsquo;s found anything or not. He&rsquo;s the new
superintendent of the high school. But it&rsquo;s time we got
dressed and had breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write to him nothing!&rdquo; said Allison eagerly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the car, and we&rsquo;ll drive over to Harmony
in no time, and get the thing fixed up. Hustle there,
Leslie, and get yourself togged up. We don&rsquo;t need
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
to wait for breakfast; we can eat cookies. Hurry
everybody!&rdquo; And he slammed over to his own room
and began to stir about noisily.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud arose and made a hasty toilet, with a
bright spot of excitement on each cheek; but she had no
time to think what Ellen would say, for she meant that
these children should have a real old-time breakfast
before they began the day; and now that she was up
her little round black clock on the bureau told her that
it was high time the day had begun. She looked fearfully
out of the window, half expecting to see Ellen&rsquo;s
Ford bobbing down the hill already, and then hurried
down to the kitchen. Allison soon came down, calling
out to her to be ready when he came back with the car;
but the delicious odors that had already begun to float
out from the old kitchen made him lenient toward the
idea of breakfast; and, when he came back with the full
cut-out roaring the announcement of his arrival to
the Perkinses, he was quite ready to wait a few minutes
and eat some of Julia Cloud&rsquo;s flapjacks and sausages
with maple-syrup and apple-sauce.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud herself ate little. She was in a tremor
of delightful uncertainty and dread. Ought she to go
ahead this way and manage her own affairs, leaving
her own sister out of the question? But then, if she
consulted with Ellen that meant consulting with
Herbert; for Herbert ran his wife most thoroughly,
and Herbert could make things very unpleasant when
he took the trouble.</p>
<p>So, when the children, unable at last to eat any
more, pleaded with her to leave the dishes and go to see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
the man about the house at once, she gave one swift,
apprehensive glance about, and assented. If Ellen
should come to the house while they were away, and
should look in at the window and see the breakfast
dishes standing! It would be appalling! But, as the
children said, why worry? Somehow she felt like a
little schoolgirl playing hookey as she carefully drew
down the dining-room and kitchen window-shades
that looked on the back porch, and locked the front
door behind her. Well, perhaps she had earned the
right to take this bit of a holiday, and wash her dishes
when she liked. Anyhow, hadn&rsquo;t God sent these blessed
children to her in answer to her earnest prayer that He
would show her what to do and save her if possible
from having to spend the remainder of her days under
Herbert Robinson&rsquo;s roof? Well, then she would just
accept it that way and be grateful, at least until He
showed her otherwise. So she drew a long breath of
delight, and climbed into the luxurious back seat of
the great blue car, utterly oblivious of the prying eyes
behind the parlor shade across the way.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>
<p>Down the little village street, past the station,
and across the railroad toward Harmony
swept the great blue car, with the villagers
turning to stare at Miss Cloud taking a ride so early
in the morning in so gaudy a car, so soon after the
funeral, and even without a veil!</p>
<p>A few minutes later Ellen in her Ford rattled up
to the door and got out with the air of one who had
come to do things. She walked confidently up to the
front door and tried it, rattled it, knocked, and then
went angrily around to the back, trying all the doors
and windows. Mrs. Perkins from her parlor window
watched a minute; and, when she saw Ellen come
around to the front again and look up at the second
story, she threw a shawl around her shoulders and
ran across the street to impart faithfully her story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the land&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; said Ellen indignantly.
&ldquo;What can Julia be about? Mother always said she
never would grow up, and I believe it. I was afraid
when I went away she had some scheme in her mind.
She&rsquo;s always getting up fool ideas. I remember that
time when Mrs. Marsh died she wanted to adopt the
twins and bring them up. The idea! When there was
a county poorhouse and no reason why they shouldn&rsquo;t
go to it! But she&rsquo;ll have to come down off her independence
and be sensible. Herbert says we can&rsquo;t have
any of her foolishness. It&rsquo;s us that would have to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
suffer if she got into trouble and lost what little she&rsquo;s
got, and I suppose I&rsquo;ve got to have it out with her once
and for all and get this thing settled. It&rsquo;s getting on all
our nerves, and I&rsquo;ve got the fall house-cleaning and
jelly to do, and I can&rsquo;t fool around any longer. Well,
I suppose I better try to get into this house. Have you
got any keys that might fit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Perkins hurried over for all her keys, including
trunk-keys; and soon they had tried every door and
every key with no effect, and had to call in the youngest
Perkins and boost him up to the upper-hall window.</p>
<p>Under the guise of looking after Julia Cloud the
two good ladies invaded her home and proceeded to
investigate. The parlor and the hall gave forth no
secrets except for a couple of handsome raincoats slung
carelessly upon chairs. But the dining-room, oh, the
dining-room! If Julia Cloud could have seen their
faces as they swung open that carefully closed door
and stood upon the threshold aghast, looking at the
wreck of the breakfast, she would have cringed and
shivered even on her way to Harmony.</p>
<p>But Julia Cloud could not see; she was safely over
the bridge and out on the highway where she would
not be likely to be followed, and the wine of the morning
was rising in her veins. Such wonderful air, such
clear blue sky and flying clouds! She felt like a flying
cloud herself as she sped along in the great blue car
with the chatter of the children in her ears and the
silvery laughter of Leslie by her side. How could she
help smiling and letting her cheeks grow pink and her
eyes grow bright? Too soon after a funeral? The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
thought did come to her. But she knew by the thrill
of her heart that her mother in heaven was gladder
now than she had been for years of her bedridden life
on earth, and, if she could look down to see, would
no doubt be happy that some joy was coming to her
hard-worked daughter at last. Julia would just enjoy
this day and this delight to the full while it lasted. If
it was not meant to last longer than the day, at least she
would have this wonderful ride to remember always,
this bird-like motion as if she were floating through a
panorama! Not a thought of Ellen poking through
her half-cleared house, finding unswept hearth and unmade
beds and unwashed dishes, came to trouble her
joy. It was as if the childhood of her life, long held in
abeyance, had come back to her, and would not
be denied.</p>
<p>Ellen and Mrs. Perkins in their inspection of the
house came at last to the upper story and the guests&rsquo;
room strewn with brushes bearing silver monograms
and elaborate appointments of travel that kept them
guessing their use and exclaiming in wonder and horror
that any one would spend so much on little details.
Leslie&rsquo;s charming silk neglig&eacute;e and her frilly little
nightgown with its lace and floating ribbons came in
for a large amount of contempt, and it was some time
before the good ladies arrived at Julia Cloud&rsquo;s room
and found the open telegram on her bureau that gave
the key to the mystery of the two visitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it! Well, I
thought she had some bee in her bonnet. She must
have written to them or they never would have come.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
Now, I suppose she means to keep them all winter,
perhaps, and feed them, and baby them up; and,
when she has spent all she has, she&rsquo;ll come
back on us. Well, she&rsquo;ll find out she&rsquo;s much mistaken;
and, when she gets back, I&rsquo;ll just tell her plainly that
she can bundle up her company and send them home
and come out to us now, to-day or to-morrow, or the
offer is withdrawn, and she needn&rsquo;t think she can fall
back on Herbert, either, when she&rsquo;s spent everything.
Herbert is not a man to be put upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; said Mrs. Perkins sympathetically,
looking over her friend&rsquo;s shoulder at the
telegram. &ldquo;So those were your brother&rsquo;s two children!
He must &rsquo;uv been pretty well off for them
to have a car like that. I must say I think it&rsquo;s a harm
to children to be brought up wealthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their mother was rich,&rdquo; said Ellen sourly. It had
always been a thorn in her flesh. &ldquo;She was a snob,
too, and her children&rsquo;ll likely be the limit by this time.
But Julia is such a fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat in Julia Cloud&rsquo;s parlor, one at each
window, discussing the probabilities until half-past
eleven. Then Ellen said she must go. She positively
couldn&rsquo;t wait another minute; but she would return,
in the afternoon, and Mrs. Perkins must tell her sister
that she was coming and wanted her to remain at home.
That it was very important.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll settle her!&rdquo; she said with her thin lips set in
a hard line. Then she stooped to crank her Ford.</p>
<p>Mrs. Perkins watched her away, then hurried to
her own neglected work; and ten minutes later the big
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
blue car sailed noiselessly up to the place. It was not
until the Perkins children discovered it and told their
mother that she knew it had arrived. This was very
annoying. She had wanted to catch them quite casually
on their arrival, and now she would have to make
a special errand over, and as likely as not have them
not come to the door again. Besides, she was getting
dinner, and things were likely to burn. Nevertheless,
she dared not wait with that big blue car standing so
capably at the door, ready to spirit them away again
at any moment. She wiped her hands on her apron,
grabbed a teacup for an excuse, and ran over to borrow
that soda once more.</p>
<p>Peals of laughter were echoing through the old
house when she knocked at the door, and a regular
rush and scramble was going on, so unseemly just after
a funeral! The door was on the latch, too, as if they
did not care who heard; and to save her life she couldn&rsquo;t
help pushing it a little with her foot, just enough to
see in. And there was Julia Cloud, her white hair
awry, and her face rosy with mirth, an ear of corn in
one hand and a knife in the other, being carried&ndash;&ndash;yes,
actually <i>carried</i>&ndash;&ndash;across the dining-room in the
arms of a tall young man and deposited firmly on the
big old couch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Cloudy Jewel! You&rsquo;ll lie right there and
rest while Leslie and I get lunch. You&rsquo;re all tired out;
I can see it in your eyes; and we can&rsquo;t afford to let
you stay so. No, we don&rsquo;t need any succotash for
lunch or dinner, either. I know it&rsquo;s good; but we haven&rsquo;t
time now, and we aren&rsquo;t going to let you work,&rdquo; announced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
the young man joyously as he towered above
her lying quiescent and weak with laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nor you aren&rsquo;t going to wash the dishes,
either,&rdquo; gurgled the young girl who danced behind the
young man; &ldquo;Allison and I will wash them all while
you take a nap, and then we&rsquo;re going to ride again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud, her eyes bright with the joy of all this
loving playfulness, tried to protest; but suddenly into
the midst of this tumult came Mrs. Perkins&rsquo;s raucous
assertion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m-m!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two young people whirled around alertly, and
Julia Cloud sat up with a wild attempt to bring her
hair into subjection as she recognized her neighbor.
The color flooded into her sweet face, but she rose with
gentle dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Mrs. Perkins, we must have been making such
a noise that we didn&rsquo;t hear your knock,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact Mrs. Perkins hadn&rsquo;t knocked.
She had been led on by curiosity until she stood in the
open dining-room door, rank disapproval written on
her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did seem a good bit of noise for a house of
mourning,&rdquo; said Mrs. Perkins dryly.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud&rsquo;s sweet eyes suddenly lost their smile,
and she drew herself up ever so little. There was just
a ripple of a quiver of her gentle lips, and she said
quite quietly and with a dignity that could not help
impressing her caller:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not a house of mourning, Mrs. Perkins.
I don&rsquo;t think my dear mother would want us to mourn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
because she was released from a bed of pain where
she had lain for nine long years, and gone to heaven
where she could be young and free and happy. I&rsquo;m
glad for her, just as glad as I can be; and I know
she would want me to be. But won&rsquo;t you sit down?
Mrs. Perkins, this is my niece and nephew, Leslie
and Allison Cloud from California. I guess you
remember them when they were little children. Or no;
you hadn&rsquo;t moved here yet when they were here&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Perkins with pursed lips acknowledged the
introduction distantly, one might almost say insolently,
and turned her back on them as if they had been little
children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your sister&rsquo;s been here all morning waiting for
you!&rdquo; she said accusingly. She gave a significant
glance at the unwashed breakfast dishes, only part of
which had been removed to the kitchen. &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t
imagine where you&rsquo;d gone at that hour an&rsquo; left your
beds and your dishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wave of indignation swept over Julia Cloud&rsquo;s
sweet face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you have been in my house during my absence!&rdquo;
she said quietly. &ldquo;That seems strange since
Ellen has no key!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing in her voice to indicate rebuke,
but Mrs. Perkins got very red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose your own sister has a right to get into
the house where she was born,&rdquo; she snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud pleasantly.
&ldquo;And Ellen used to be a good climber before she got
so fat. I suppose she climbed in the second-story window,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
although I hadn&rsquo;t realized she could. However, it
doesn&rsquo;t matter. I suppose you have had to leave your
dishes and beds once in a while when you were called
away on business. You have a cup there; did you
want to borrow something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Perkins was one of those people who are never
quite aware of it when they are in a corner; but she felt
most uncomfortable, especially as she caught a stifled
giggle from Allison, who bolted into the parlor hastily
and began noisily to turn over the pages of a book on
the table; but she managed to ask for her soda and
get herself out of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for bringing my sister&rsquo;s message,&rdquo;
called Julia Cloud after her. She never could quite
bear to be unpleasant even to a prying neighbor, and
Mrs. Perkins through the years had managed to make
herself unpleasant many times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old cat!&rdquo; said Leslie in a clear, carrying
voice. &ldquo;Why did you thank her, Auntie Jewel? She
didn&rsquo;t deserve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Leslie, dear! She will hear you!&rdquo; said
Julia Cloud, hastily closing the door on the last words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope she did,&rdquo; said Leslie comfortably. &ldquo;I
<i>meant</i> she should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, deary, that isn&rsquo;t right! It isn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;Christian!&rdquo;
said her aunt in distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m no Christian,&rdquo; chanted Leslie mischievously.
&ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t it right, I&rsquo;d like to know? Isn&rsquo;t she
an old cat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you hurt her feelings, dear. I&rsquo;m afraid I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
was to blame, too; I didn&rsquo;t answer her any too
sweetly myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, didn&rsquo;t she hurt yours first? <i>Sweet!</i> Why,
you were honey itself, Cloudy, dear, thanking her for
her old prying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s the kind of honey that gets bitter after
you swallow it!&rdquo; growled Allison, coming out of the
parlor. &ldquo;If she&rsquo;d said much more, I&rsquo;d just have put
her out of the house, talking to you like that, as if you
were a little child, Cloudy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, children! That didn&rsquo;t really hurt me any;
it just stirred up my temper a little; but I&rsquo;m ashamed
that I let it, and I don&rsquo;t want you to talk like that. It
isn&rsquo;t a bit right. It distresses me to have you think it&rsquo;s
right to answer back that way and take vengeance
on people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there, Cloudy, let&rsquo;s lay that subject on the
table for some of our night talks; and you can scold us
all you like. We have a lot of work to do now, and let&rsquo;s
forget the old pry. Now you lie down on that couch
where I put you, and Leslie and I&rsquo;ll wash these dishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud lay obediently on the couch, but her
mind was not at rest. She was in a tumult of indignation
at her prying neighbor and an uncertainty of
anxiety about Ellen and what she might do next. But
beneath it all was a vague fear about these her dear
children who were about to become her responsibility.
Could she do it? Dared she do it? How differently
they had been brought up from all the traditions which
had controlled her life!</p>
<p>Take, for instance, that matter of Christianity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
How would they feel about it? Would they be in sympathy
with her ideas and ideals of right and wrong?
They were no longer little children to obey her. They
would have ideas of their own, yes, and ideals. Would
there be constant clashing? Would she be haunted
with a feeling that she was not doing her duty by them?
There were so many such questions, amusements, and
Sabbath, and churchgoing, and how to treat other people.
And doubtless she was old-fashioned, and they
would chafe under her rule.</p>
<p>Take the little matter of Leslie&rsquo;s calling Mrs.
Perkins a cat. She <i>was</i> a cat, but Leslie ought not to
have told her so. It wasn&rsquo;t polite, and it wasn&rsquo;t Christian.
And yet how could she, plain Julia Cloud, who
had never been anywhere much outside of her home
town, who had had no opportunity for study or wide
reading, and who had only worked quietly all her life,
and thought her plain little thoughts of love to God
and to her neighbors, be able to explain all those things
to this pair of lovable, uncontrolled children, who had
always had their own way, and whose ideals were the
ideals of the great wide unchristian world?</p>
<p>A little pucker grew between her brows, and a tired,
troubled tear stole softly between her lashes. When
the children, tiptoeing about and whispering, came to
peek in at the door and see whether she was asleep, they
discovered her expression at once, and, drawing near,
sighted the tear. Then they went down upon their
knees beside her couch, and noisily demanded the
cause thereof.</p>
<p>Little by little they drew her fears from her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Cloudy, dear! We&rsquo;ll do what you want.
We&rsquo;ll let all the old cats in the community walk over
you if that will make you happy,&rdquo; declared Leslie,
patting her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; put in Allison; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll keep &rsquo;em
away from her, but we won&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em know how we
despise &rsquo;em. Won&rsquo;t that do, Cloudy? And as for all
those other things you are afraid about, why couldn&rsquo;t
you just wait till we come to them? We&rsquo;re anything
but angels, I admit, but we&rsquo;re going to try to do what
you want us to if it busts the eye-teeth out of us, because
we want you. And you always have been such a
good scout. As for the church dope and all that, why,
it&rsquo;s like that guy in the Bible you used to tell us about
when we were children&ndash;&ndash;or was she a lady? It&rsquo;s a case
of &lsquo;Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my
God,&rsquo; or words to that effect. If we don&rsquo;t agree on our
own account, we&rsquo;ll do it because you want it. Isn&rsquo;t that
about the idea? Wouldn&rsquo;t that fill the bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear children!&rdquo; said Julia Cloud, her eyes
full of smiles and tears now as she gathered them
both into a loving embrace. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how anybody
could promise more than that. I wasn&rsquo;t afraid
of you; it was myself. You know I&rsquo;m not at all wise,
and it&rsquo;s pretty late in life for me to begin to bring
up children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re all right, anyhow, Cloudy; and
you&rsquo;re the only person in the world we&rsquo;ll let bring us
up; so it&rsquo;s up to you to do it the best you can, or it won&rsquo;t
get done. Come on now; we&rsquo;ve got lunch ready.
There&rsquo;s cold chicken and bread and milk and pie and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
cake, and I&rsquo;ve got the teakettle boiling like a house afire,
so if you want any tea or anything you can have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they had a merry meal, and Julia Cloud ate and
laughed with them, and thought she never had been
so happy since she was a little girl. Then, mindful of
her prying neighbor and her imminent sister, she insisted
on putting the house in order to the last bed and
dish before she was ready for the afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now we&rsquo;re going to call on Aunt Ellen!&rdquo;
announced Allison as Julia Cloud hung up the clean
dish-towels steaming from their scalding bath, and
washed her hands at the sink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s coming here!&rdquo; said his aunt, whirling
around with a troubled look. &ldquo;And, as she&rsquo;s left word
she was coming, I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to wait for her.
It&rsquo;s too bad, for she won&rsquo;t be here till three, and it&rsquo;s
only a quarter of two. I&rsquo;m sorry, because you wanted
to go out in the car, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going!&rdquo; said Allison, again with a commanding
twinkle in his eye. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t waste all that
time; and, besides, don&rsquo;t you see if she comes here,
she&rsquo;ll likely stay all the afternoon and argue? If we
go there, we can come away when we like; and she&rsquo;ll
feel we&rsquo;re more polite to come to her, anyhow, won&rsquo;t
she, Cloudy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud looked into the boy&rsquo;s convincing eyes,
and her trouble cleared away. Perhaps he was right.
Anyhow, why should they spoil a whole day to conciliate
Ellen? Ellen would be disagreeable about it, however
they did; and they might as well rise above it, and just
be pleasant, and let it go at that.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>It was the first time in her long life of self-sacrifice
that Julia Cloud had been able to rise above her anxiety
about her sister&rsquo;s tantrums and go calmly on her way.
It is scarcely likely that she would have managed it now
if it hadn&rsquo;t been that she felt that Allison and Leslie
ought not to be sacrificed.</p>
<p>She never did anything just for herself. It was
not in her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she said briskly, glancing at the clock;
&ldquo;then we must go at once, or we shall miss her. I&rsquo;ll be
ready in five minutes. How about you, Leslie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m ready now,&rdquo; said the girl, patting her
curly hair into shape before the old mahogany-framed
mirror in the hall.</p>
<p>In five minutes more they were stowed away in
the big blue car again, speeding down the road, with
Mrs. Perkins indignantly and openly watching them
from her front porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We put one over on Mrs. Pry, didn&rsquo;t we,
Cloudy?&rdquo; said Allison, turning around to wink a
naughty eye back toward the Perkins house. &ldquo;She
thinks you&rsquo;ve dared to run away after she gave you
orders to stay at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud could not suppress a smile of enjoyment,
and wondered whether she was getting childish
that she should be so happy with these children.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<p>The air was fine; the sky was clear without a
cloud; and the spice of autumn flavored everything.
Along the roadside blackberry vines
were turning scarlet, and here and there in the
distance a flaming branch proclaimed the approach of a
frosty wooing. One could not ask anything better on
such a day than to be speeding along this white velvet
road in the great blue car with two beloved children.</p>
<p>But all too soon Herbert Robinson&rsquo;s ornate house
loomed up, stark and green, with very white trimmings,
and regular flower-beds each side of the gravel
walk. It was the home of a prosperous man, and
as such asserted itself. There had never been anything
attractive about it to Julia Cloud. She preferred the
ugly old house in which she had always lived, with its
scaling gray paint and no pretensions to fineness. At
least it was softened by age, and had a look of experience
which saved its ugliness from being crude, and
gave it the dignity of time.</p>
<p>And now Julia Cloud&rsquo;s heart began to beat rapidly.
All at once she felt that she had done a most foolish
thing in allowing the children to overrule her and
bring her here. Ellen would not be dressed up nor have
the children ready for inspection, and she would be
angry at her sister for not having given warning of
their coming. She leaned forward breathlessly to suggest
turning back; but Allison, perhaps anticipating her
feeling, said:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you get cold feet, Cloudy Jewel. If
Aunt Ellen is sore, just you talk up to her, and smile
a lot, and we&rsquo;ll back you up. Remember everything&rsquo;s,
going fine, and the whole thing&rsquo;s settled. It&rsquo;s too late
to change it now. Is this the place? We&rsquo;ll turn right
in, shall we?&rdquo; And with the words he swept up under
the elaborate wooden porte-coch&egrave;re, and, swinging
down, flung the door open for Julia Cloud to alight.</p>
<p>Leslie gave a quick, disdainful glance about, fluttered
out beside her aunt, and, catching the look of
apprehension on her face, tripped up the steps and
rang the bell, poising bird-like on the threshold and
calling in a sweet, flute-like voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Ellen! O Aunt Ellen! Where are you?
Don&rsquo;t you know you&rsquo;ve got company all the way
from California?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was just like taking the bull by the horns, and
Julia Cloud paused on the upper step in wonder. How
winning a child she was! and how she had known by
intuition just how to mollify her unpleasant relative!</p>
<p>What would Ellen say? How would she take it?</p>
<p>Ellen Robinson bustled frowning into the hall,
whetting her sharp tongue for an encounter. She had
seen the big blue car turn in at the gate, and knew
from Mrs. Perkins&rsquo;s description who it must be. Julia
Cloud had well judged her state of mind, for her four
children could not have been caught in a worse plight
so far as untidiness was concerned, and there had barely
been time to marshal them all up the back stairs with
orders to scrub and dress or not to come down till the
visitors were gone. They were even now creeping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
shufflingly about overhead on their bare feet, hunting
for their respective best shoes and stockings and other
garments, and scrapping in loud whispers.</p>
<p>But Leslie, little diplomat that she was, wasted no
time in taking stock of her aunt. She flung her
arms joyously around that astonished woman, and
fairly took her by storm, talking volubly and continuously
until they were all in the house and seated in
Ellen&rsquo;s best satin brocatelle parlor chairs, surrounded
by crayon portraits of Herbert Robinson&rsquo;s ancestors
and descendants. Allison too caught on to his sister&rsquo;s
game, and talked a good deal about how nice it was to
get East again after all the years, and how glad they
were to have some relatives of their own. Julia Cloud
sat quietly and proudly listening; and Ellen forgot her
anger, and ceased to frown. After all, it was something
to have such good-looking relatives. For the first
few minutes the well-prepared speech wherewith she
had intended to dress down poor Julia lay idle on her
lips, and a few sentences of grudging welcome even,
managed to slip by. Then suddenly she turned to her
sister, and the sight of the adoration for the visitors
in Julia&rsquo;s transparent face kindled her anger. Never
had such a look as this glowed in Julia Cloud&rsquo;s face for
any little Robinson, save perhaps in the first few days
of their tiny lives before the Robinson had begun to
crop out in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you this morning, Jule? It certainly
seems queer for you to be gadding around having a
good time so soon after poor mother&rsquo;s death. And the
dishes not washed, either! Upon my word, you have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
lost your head! You weren&rsquo;t brought up that way. I
stood up-stairs and looked around on those unmade
beds, and thought what poor mother would have said
if she could see them. Such goings-on! I certainly was
ashamed to have Mrs. Perkins see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two rosy spots bloomed out on Julia Cloud&rsquo;s cheeks,
and a tremble came in her lips, though one could see she
was making a great effort to control herself; and the
two long breaths that Leslie and Allison drew simultaneously
were heavily threatening, much like the distant
rumble of thunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t see what occasion Mrs. Perkins
had to see it,&rdquo; she answered steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she was there!&rdquo; said her sister dryly. She
seemed to have forgotten the presence of the two
young people, who, if they had been in the foreground,
might have been noticed doing things with their eyebrows
to their mutual understanding and agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so she told me,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud significantly.
&ldquo;But that was not what I came over to talk about,
Ellen; I wanted to let you know that I&rsquo;ve rented the
house, and the tenant wants possession next week. I
thought you might like to pick out some of mother&rsquo;s
things to bring over here before I pack up. You spoke
about wishing you had another couch for the sitting-room,
and you might just as well have the dining-room
one as not. Then I thought perhaps you could use
mother&rsquo;s bedroom suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve rented the house!&rdquo; screamed Ellen as
soon as she got breath from her astonishment to interrupt.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve rented the house without consulting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
me? Who to, I&rsquo;d like to know? I had a tenant
already for that house, I told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I had no time to consult you, Ellen; and,
besides, why should I? The house is mine, and I knew
you didn&rsquo;t want it. You have your own home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you certainly are blossoming out and getting
independent! I should think mere decency would have
made you consult us before you did anything. What
do you know about business? Herbert will be mad as
anything when I tell him; and like as not you&rsquo;ll get into
no end of trouble with a strange tenant, and we&rsquo;ll have
to help you out. Herbert always says women make
all the trouble they can for him before they call on
him for assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not be obliged to call on Herbert for assistance,
Ellen. Everything is arranged. The contract
was signed this morning, and I have promised to vacate
as soon as possible. The tenant is the new school superintendent,
and he wants to come at once. I just heard
last evening that he had been disappointed in getting
the Harvey house. It&rsquo;s sold to the foreman of the mill.
So I went over to Harmony to see him at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news was so overwhelming and so unquestionably
satisfactory from a business point of view that
Ellen was speechless with astonishment. Allison gave
Leslie a grave wink, and turned to look out of the window
to prevent an outburst of giggles from his sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think you might have let me know,&rdquo; Ellen
resumed with almost her usual poise. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather
mortifying not to know what&rsquo;s going on in your own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
family when the neighbors ask. Here was I without
any knowledge of the arrival of my own niece and
nephew! Had to be told by Mrs. Perkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Allison and Leslie did laugh, but they veiled
their mirth by talking about the two white chickens out
in the yard which were contending for a worm. Suddenly
Leslie exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Allison! I hear the children coming down-stairs,
and I forgot their presents! Run out to the car,
and bring me that box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison was off at once, and the entrance of the
soapy and embarrassed children created a further
diversion.</p>
<p>For a few minutes even Ellen Robinson was absorbed
in the presents. There was a camera for Junior,
a gold chain and locket for Elaine, a beautiful doll for
Dorothy, and a small train of cars that would wind up
and run on a miniature track for Bertie; so of course
everything had to be looked at and tried. Elaine put
on her chain, and preened herself before the glass;
Junior had to understand at once just how to take a
picture; everybody had to watch the doll open and shut
its eyes, and to try to unbutton and button its coat and
dress; and then the railroad track had to be set up
and the train started off on its rounds. Ellen Robinson
really looked almost motherly while she watched her
happy children; and Julia Cloud relaxed, and let the
smile come around her lips once more.</p>
<p>But all things come to an end, and Ellen Robinson
was not one to forget her own affairs for long at a time.
She sat back from starting the engine on its third round,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
and fixed her eyes on her sister with that air of commander-general
that was so intolerable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I suppose you won&rsquo;t be over here till
next week,&rdquo; she frowned thoughtfully. &ldquo;I needed you
to help with the crabapple jelly. That makes it inconvenient.
But perhaps I can hold off the fruit a little
longer; I&rsquo;ll see. You ought to be able to get all your
packing done this week, I should think. When do
they go?&rdquo; She nodded toward the niece and nephew
quite indifferently as though they were deaf.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud&rsquo;s sensitive face flushed with annoyance,
but the two pairs of bright eyes that lifted and fixed
themselves upon their aunt held nothing but enjoyment
of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;re not going until Aunt Jewel is ready
to go with us, Aunt Ellen,&rdquo; announced Leslie, looking
up from the doll she was reclothing. &ldquo;You know
we&rsquo;re all going to college together, Auntie, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen Robinson lifted an indignant chin. She had
no sense of humor, and did not enjoy jokes, especially
those practised upon herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to college! At her age!&rdquo; she snorted.
&ldquo;Well, I always knew she was childish, but I never
expected her to want to go back to kindergarten!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie rose up straight as a rush, her strong young
arms down at her sides, her fingers in their soft su&egrave;de
gloves working restively as if she wanted to rush at
her aunt and administer corporal punishment. Her
pretty red lips were pursed angrily, and her blue eyes
fairly blazed righteous wrath. Julia Cloud caught her
breath, and wondered how she was to control this young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
fury; but before she could say a word Allison stepped
in front of her, and spoke coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the reason she&rsquo;s such a good scout, Aunt
Ellen. That&rsquo;s why we want her to come and take care
of us. Because she knows how to stay young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suddenly seemed to have grown very tall and
quite mature as he spoke, and there was something
about his manly bearing that held Ellen Robinson&rsquo;s
tongue in check as he looked at his watch with a polite
&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; and then turned to Julia Cloud. &ldquo;Aunt
Jewel, if we are to meet my guardian on that train, I
think we shall have to hurry. It&rsquo;s quite a run into the
city, you know.&rdquo; Julia Cloud arose with a breath
of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The city!&rdquo; gasped Ellen. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going into
the city this late in the afternoon, I hope! Do you
know how long it takes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison glanced out to his high-powered machine
confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We made it in an hour and a half coming over.
I guess we shall have plenty of time to meet the five-o&rsquo;clock
train if we go at once. I&rsquo;ve got a peach of a car,
Aunt Ellen. I&rsquo;ll have to come round and take you and
the kids a ride to-morrow or the next day if Aunt Jewel
can spare me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you! I have a car of my own!&rdquo; snapped
his aunt disagreeably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I beg your pardon! Well, Aunt Jewel, we
really must go if we are to meet Mr. Luddington.
Good-by, Aunt Ellen! Good-by, cousins! We&rsquo;ll see
you again before we leave town, of course. Come on,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
Aunt Jewel!&rdquo; And he took Julia Cloud lightly, protectingly
by the elbow, and steered her out of the room,
down the steps, and into the car, while Leslie danced
gayly after, chattering away about how nice it was to
get back East and meet real relatives.</p>
<p>But Ellen Robinson was not listening to Leslie.
She hurried after her departing guests regardless of a
noisy struggle that was going on between her two
youngest over the railway train, and stood on her front
steps, fairly snorting with indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julia Cloud, what does all this mean? You shan&rsquo;t
go away until you explain. Have you taken leave of
your senses? What is this nonsense about going
to college?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison with his hand on the starter gave his aunt
a swift, reassuring smile; and Julia Cloud from the
safe vantage of the back seat leaned forward, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s the children that are going to college,
Ellen, not I. I&rsquo;m only going along to keep house and
play mother for them. Isn&rsquo;t it lovely? I&rsquo;ll tell you all
about it to-morrow when you come down to pick out
your things. Be sure to come early, because I want to
get started packing the first thing in the morning. Mr.
Luddington, the children&rsquo;s guardian, is coming to-night
to complete the arrangements, and we expect to get
away just as soon as I can get packed up. So
come early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engine purred softly for a rhythmical second,
and the car slid quickly away from the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;the very idea!&rdquo; snorted Aunt Ellen. &ldquo;Julia
Cloud!&rdquo; she fairly shouted. &ldquo;Stop! You had no right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
in the world to go ahead and make plans without consulting
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the car was beyond ear-shot now, and Leslie
was waving a pretty, tantalizing hand from the
back seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very idea!&rdquo; Ellen Robinson gasped to the
autumn landscape as she stood alone and watched the
car, a mere speck down the road, on its way to town.
&ldquo;The idea!&rdquo; And then as if for self-justification:
&ldquo;Poor mother! What would she think if she could
know? Well, I wash my hands of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ellen Robinson did not wash her hands of her
sister. Instead, she found that it was going to be very
hard indeed to wash her hands of her own affairs without
her sister&rsquo;s help. She had, in fact, been counting
on that help for the last several years, after her mother
became an invalid and she knew that it was only a
matter of time before Julia&rsquo;s hands would be set free
for other labor. It was quite too disconcerting now,
after having got along all these years on the strength
of the help that was to come, to find her capable sister
snatched away from her by two young things in this
ridiculous way.</p>
<p>They talked it over at supper, and Herbert was
almost savage about it, as if in some way his wife had
misrepresented the possibilities, and led him to expect
the assistance that would come from her sister and save
him from paying wages to a servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;ll be good and sick of it inside of three
months, mark my words; and then she&rsquo;ll come whining
back and want us to take her in;&ndash;&ndash;be glad enough to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
get a home. So don&rsquo;t you worry. But what I want
understood is this: <i>She&rsquo;s not going to find it so easy
to get back.</i> See? You make her thoroughly understand
that. You better go down to-morrow and pick
out everything you want. Take plenty. You can&rsquo;t tell
but something may happen to the house, and the furniture
burn up. We might as well have it as anybody.
And you make it good and sure that she understands
right here and now that if she goes she doesn&rsquo;t come
back. Of course, I&rsquo;m not saying she can&rsquo;t come back
if she comes to her senses, and is real humble; but
you needn&rsquo;t let her know that. Just give her to understand
it is her last chance, that I can&rsquo;t be monkeyed
with this way. I&rsquo;ve offered her a very generous thing,
and she knows it, and she&rsquo;s a fool, that&rsquo;s what she is,
a <i>fool</i> I say!&rdquo; He brought his big fist down heavily
on the table, and jarred the dishes; and the children
looked up in premature comprehension, storing up the
epithet for future use. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s no end of a fool, going
off with those crazy kids. Some one ought to warn
their guardian about her. Why, she has no more idea
of how to take care of two high and mighty good-for-nothings
like that than an infant in arms!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meantime the subject of their discussion was seated
serenely at a table in one of the best hotels of the great
city, having the time of her life. In the years that were
to come there might be many more delightful suppers,
even more elegantly served, perhaps; but none would
ever rival this first time in her existence when she had
sat among the wealthy and great of the land and been
treated like one of them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>Mr. Luddington was a typical business man, elderly
and kind, with wise eyes and a great smile. He turned
his eyes keenly on Julia Cloud for an instant at their
first meeting, then let his full smile envelop her, and
she was somehow made aware of the fact that he had
set his seal of approval to the contract already made
by his two enthusiastic wards. All the forebodings she
had entertained in the little intervals when Leslie and
Allison allowed her to think at all were swept aside by
his kind look and big, serious tone when he first took
her hand and scanned her true face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad they&rsquo;ve
picked such a woman!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have your
hands full, for they&rsquo;re a pair! But it&rsquo;s worth it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, when they all rode home through the moonlight,
Julia Cloud nestled under the soft, thick robes of
the car, and listened to the pleasant talk between the
young people and their guardian with a sense of peace.
If this strong, wise business man thought the arrangement
was all right, why, then she need not fear any
longer. It was real, and not a dream, and she might
rely upon the wisdom of her decision. And with that
sense of being upheld by something wiser than her own
wish she fell asleep that night, haunted by no dreams
of her domineering sister.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>
<p>The pleasant aromas of coffee and sausages were
mingling in the air when &ldquo;Guardy Lud&rdquo; woke
up and looked about the old-fashioned room
with a sense of satisfaction. The very pictures on the
walls rested him, they reminded him so much of the
rooms in his boyhood home. He had a feeling that old-fashioned
things were best, and in spite of the fact
that he owned a house most different from this one
himself and knew that his wife would not for a minute
have tolerated any old-fashioned things about unless
they were so old-fashioned that they had become the
latest rage, he could not help feeling that a woman
brought up amid such simple surroundings would be the
very best kind to mother these orphan children who
had been left on his helpless hands. He would have
loved to take them to his heart and his home; but his
wife was not so minded, and that ended it. But it
rolled a great burden from his shoulders to feel that he
might leave them in such capable hands.</p>
<p>They had a rollicking time at breakfast, for Guardy
Lud was delighted with the crisp brown sausages, fried
potatoes, and buckwheats with real maple-syrup; and
he laughed, and ate, and told stories with the children,
and kept the old dining-room walls ringing with joy as
they had not resounded within the memory of Julia
Cloud. Then suddenly the door opened, and there stood
Ellen Robinson, disapproval and hauteur written in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
every line of her unpleasant face! One could hardly
imagine how those two, Julia and Ellen, could possibly
be sisters.</p>
<p>Dismay filled Julia Cloud&rsquo;s heart for an instant, and
brought a pallor to her cheek. How had she forgotten
Ellen? What a fool she had been to tell Ellen to come
early in the morning! But she had not realized that
Mr. Luddington would be willing to come out to her
humble home and stay all night. She had supposed
that the arrangements would be made in the city. However,
it could not be helped now; and a glance at the
kind, strong face of the white-haired man gave her
courage. Ellen could not really spoil their plans with
him there. He felt that the arrangement was good,
and with him to back her she felt she could stand out
against any arguments her sister might bring forth.</p>
<p>So she rose with a natural ease, and introduced her.
&ldquo;My sister Mrs. Robinson, Mr. Luddington&rdquo;; and
Ellen stiffly and still disapprovingly acknowledged the
introduction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t interrupt,&rdquo; she said disagreeably. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
just going up to look over some of my mother&rsquo;s things.&rdquo;
And she turned to the back stairway, and went up, closing
the door behind her.</p>
<p>Mr. Luddington gazed after her a second; and
then, taking his glasses off and wiping them energetically,
he remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, bless my soul! It must be getting
late! We&rsquo;ve had such a good time I didn&rsquo;t realize.
Those certainly were good buckwheats, Miss Cloud.
I shan&rsquo;t forget them very soon. And now I suppose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
we&rsquo;d better get down to business. Could we just go
into the other room there, and close the door for a few
minutes, not to be interrupted?&rdquo; and he cast an anxious
glance toward the stair-door again.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud smiled understandingly, and ushered
them into the little parlor ablaze with fall sunshine, its
windows wreathed about with crimsoning woodbine;
and, as she caught the glow and glint from the window,
she remembered the gray evening when she had looked
out across into her future as she supposed it would be.
How beautiful and wonderful that the gray had
changed to glow! As she sat down to enter into the
contract that was to bind her to a new and wonderful
life with great responsibilities and large possibilities,
her heart, accustomed to look upward, sent a whisper
of thanksgiving heavenward.</p>
<p>The details did not take long, after all; for Mr.
Luddington was a keen business man, and he had gone
over the whole proposition, and had the plan in writing
for her to sign, telling just what were her duties and
responsibilities with regard to his wards, just how
much money she would have for housekeeping and servants
and other expenses, and the salary she would
receive herself for accepting this care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re practically in a position of mother to
them, you know,&rdquo; he said, beaming at her genially;
&ldquo;and I declare I never laid eyes on a woman that I
thought could fill the part better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud was quite overwhelmed. But the matter
of the salary troubled her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I think it should not be a matter of money,&rdquo; she
demurred. &ldquo;I would rather do it for love, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; said the old man, smiling; &ldquo;but
this thing has got to be on a business basis, or the terms
of the will will not allow me to agree to it. You see
what you are going to undertake means work, and
it means sticking to it; and you deserve pay for it, and
we&rsquo;re not going to accept several of the best years out
of your life for nothing. Besides, you&rsquo;ve got to feel
free to give up the job if it proves too burdensome
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you to dismiss me if I do not prove capable
for the position,&rdquo; suggested Julia Cloud, lifting meek
and honest eyes to meet his gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well, I can see there won&rsquo;t be any
need of that!&rdquo; sputtered the old gentleman pleasantly.
&ldquo;But, however that is, this is the contract I&rsquo;ve made
out. And I&rsquo;m quite satisfied. So are the children.
Are you willing to sign it? Of course there&rsquo;s a clause
in there about reasonable notice if there is dissatisfaction
on either side; that lets you out at any time you
get tired of it. Only give me a chance to look after
these youngsters properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud took the pen eagerly, tremblingly, a
sense of wonder in her pounding heart, and signed her
name just as Ellen&rsquo;s heavy footsteps could be heard
pounding down the back stairs. Leslie seized Julia,
and gave her a great hug as the last letter was finished,
and then threw open the parlor door in the nick of time
to save her Aunt Ellen from seeming to be deserted.</p>
<p>Ellen Robinson appeared on the scene just in time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
to witness the hearty hand-shake that Guardy Lud gave
Julia Cloud as he picked up the papers and went up-stairs
for his suitcase while Allison went after the
car to take him to the train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that man married? Because, if he isn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t
think it&rsquo;s respectable for you to go and live near him!&rdquo;
declared Ellen in a penetrating voice to the intense distress
of Julia Cloud, who was happily hurrying the
dishes from the breakfast table.</p>
<p>But Leslie came to the rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed, Aunt Ellen, he&rsquo;s very much married!
Altogether too much married for comfort. He would
be a dear if it wasn&rsquo;t for his silly little old bossy wife!
But he doesn&rsquo;t intend to live anywhere near us. His
home is off in California, and he&rsquo;s going back next
week. He&rsquo;s only waiting to see us settled somewhere
before he goes back; so you needn&rsquo;t worry about Aunt
Jewel&rsquo;s morals. We&rsquo;ll take good care of her. But
isn&rsquo;t he a dear? He was my Grandfather Leslie&rsquo;s
best friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie chattered on gayly till the visitor&rsquo;s footsteps
could be heard coming down-stairs again, and Ellen
Robinson could only shut her lips tight and go into
the kitchen, from which her sister beat immediately a
hasty retreat lest more unpleasant remarks should
be forthcoming.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud bade Mr. Luddington good-by, standing
on her own front steps, and then waited a moment,
looking off toward the hills which had shut in her vision
all her life. The two young people had rushed down
to the car, and were pulling their guardian joyously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
inside. They seemed to do everything joyously, like two
young creatures let out of prison into the sunshine.
Julia Cloud smiled at the thought of them, but her
soul was not watching them just then. She was looking
off to the hills that had been her strength all the
years through so many trials, and gathering strength
now to go in and meet her sister in final combat. She
knew that there would be a scene; that was inevitable.
That she might maintain her calmness and say nothing
unkind or regrettable she was praying earnestly now
as her eyes sought the hills.</p>
<p>Across the road behind her parlor curtains Mrs.
Perkins was keeping lookout, and remarking to a
neighbor who had run in:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I thought as much. There&rsquo;s always a man
in the case when a woman acts queer! Now, doesn&rsquo;t
that beat all? Do you suppose he&rsquo;s a long-lost lover or
something, come back now he knows she&rsquo;s free? Seems
to me I did hear there was somebody died or something
before we came here to live, but she must have been
awful young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car moved noisily away, and the old gentleman
leaned out with a courteous lift of his hat toward
Julia Cloud. She acknowledged it with a bow and a
smile which Mrs. Perkins pounced on and analyzed
audibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no fool like an old fool, as the saying
is! Just watch her smirk! I&rsquo;m mighty glad Ellen
Robinson&rsquo;s there to relieve me of the responsibility.
She&rsquo;ll be over after a while, and then we&rsquo;ll know who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
he is. There goes Julia in. She watched him out o&rsquo;
sight! Well, I wonder what her mother would think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud went slowly back to the dining-room,
where Ellen was seated on the couch, waiting like a
visitor. Julia&rsquo;s smile was utterly lost on her glum
countenance, which resembled an embattled tower
under siege.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she said as Julia began to gather up
more dishes from the breakfast table. &ldquo;I suppose you
think you&rsquo;ve done something smart now, don&rsquo;t you,
getting that old snob here and fixing things all up without
consulting any of your relatives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Ellen, this has all been so sudden that I
had no opportunity,&rdquo; said Julia gently. &ldquo;But it did
not seem likely that you would object, for you suggested
yourself that I rent the house, and you said you
did not want me to stay here alone. This seemed
quite providential.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Providential!&rdquo; sniffed Ellen. &ldquo;Providential to
take you away from your own home and your own
people, and send you out into a world where nobody
really cares for you, and where all they want of you
is to make a drudge of you! You call that providential,
do you? Well, I <i>don&rsquo;t</i>! And when I object, and try
to save you from yourself, and offer you a good home
where you will be cared for all the rest of your days,
right among your own, where mother would have
wanted to see you, you will probably get high-headed,
and say I am interfering with your rights. But I can&rsquo;t
help it. I&rsquo;ve got to speak. I can&rsquo;t see you put the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
halter around your neck to hang yourself without doing
everything I can to stop it. My own sister!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Ellen, dear!&rdquo; said Julia Cloud eagerly,
sitting down beside her sister. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand.
It isn&rsquo;t in the least that way. I&rsquo;m sorry I had to spring
it on you so suddenly and give you such a wrong
impression. You know I couldn&rsquo;t think of coming to
live on you and Herbert. It was kind of you to suggest
it, and I am grateful and all that; but I know
how it would be to have some one else, even a sister,
come into the home, and I couldn&rsquo;t think of it. I have
always resolved that I would never be dependent on my
relatives while I had my health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen sat up bristling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you are willing to go away to some
strange place where nobody knows you, and slave for
a couple of little snobs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Ellen!&rdquo; said Julia pleadingly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
understand. I am not going to slave. I&rsquo;m just going
to be a sort of mother to them. And you oughtn&rsquo;t to
call them snobs. They are your own brother&rsquo;s children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Own brother&rsquo;s children, nothing!&rdquo; sneered Ellen.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been away so many years he was just like a
stranger when he came back the last time, and as for
the children they are just like his stuck-up wife and
her family. Yet you&rsquo;ll leave the children that were
born and raised close beside you, and go and slave for
them. Mother! fiddlesticks! You&rsquo;ll slave all right.
I know you. In six weeks you&rsquo;ll be a drudge for them
the way you&rsquo;ve been all your life! I know how it is,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
and you may not believe it; but I have feelings for
my sister, and I don&rsquo;t like to see her put upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen fumbled for her handkerchief, and managed
a comely tear or two that quite touched Julia&rsquo;s heart.
Affection between them even when Ellen was a child
had been quite one-sided; for Ellen had always been a
selfish, spoiled little thing, and Julia had looked in vain
for any signs of tenderness. Now her heart warmed
toward her younger sister in this long-delayed thoughtfulness,
and her tone grew gentler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s dear of you, Ellen, and I appreciate it; but
I haven&rsquo;t been able to make you understand yet, I see.
I&rsquo;m not to be a worker, nor even a housekeeper. I&rsquo;m
to be just a sort of mother, or aunt, if you please, to
see that the house runs all right, to be with the children
and have a happy time with them and their young
friends, and to see that they are cared for in every
way necessary; just a housemother, you understand. I
am to have servants to do the work, although I&rsquo;m sure
one servant will be all that I shall want in a little household
like that. But Mr. Luddington quite insisted there
should be servants, and that no work of any sort should
fall upon me. He said that as their nearest relative I
was to be in the position of mother and guardian to
them, and to preside over their home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous!&rdquo; put in Ellen. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
they go to college and board like any other reasonable
young folks if they must go to college at all? I think
it&rsquo;s all nonsense for &rsquo;em to go. What do they do
it for? They&rsquo;ve got money, and don&rsquo;t have to teach
or anything. What do they need of learning? They&rsquo;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
got enough now to get along. That girl thinks she&rsquo;s
too smart to live. I call her impudent, for my part!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They want a home,&rdquo; said Julia, waiving the subject
of higher education; &ldquo;and they have chosen me,
and I mean to do my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a quiet finality in her tone that impressed
her sister. She looked at her angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you will, you will, I suppose. Nobody
can stop you. But I see just what will come of it.
You&rsquo;ll fool away a little while there, and find out how
mistaken you were; and then you&rsquo;ll come back to
Herbert to be taken care of. And you don&rsquo;t realize how
offended Herbert is going to be by your actions, and
how he&rsquo;ll feel about letting you come back after you
have gone away in such high feather. You haven&rsquo;t
anything to speak of to support yourself, of course, and
how on earth do you expect to live anyway after these
children get through their college and get married or
something? They won&rsquo;t want you then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia arose and went to the window to get calmed.
She was more angry than she had been for years. The
thought of Herbert&rsquo;s having to take care of her ever
was intolerable. But she was able to hold her tongue
until she could get her eyes on those hills out of the
window. &ldquo;I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from
whence cometh my help.&rdquo; That had been the verse
which she had read from her little Bible before leaving
her room in the early morning and she was grappling it
close to her heart, for she had known it would be
a hard day.</p>
<p>Ellen was watching her silently. Almost she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
thought she had made an impression. Perhaps this was
the time to repeat Herbert&rsquo;s threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herbert feels,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;that if you refuse his
offer now he can&rsquo;t promise to keep it open. He can&rsquo;t
be responsible for you if you take this step. He said
he wanted you to understand thoroughly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud turned and walked with swift step to
the little parlor where lay the paper she and Mr. Luddington
had just signed, and a copy of which he had
taken with him. She returned to her astonished sister
with the paper in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it would be just as well for you to read
this,&rdquo; she said with dignity, and put the paper into
Ellen&rsquo;s hands, going back to her clearing of the table.</p>
<p>There was silence in the dining-room while Ellen
read, Julia moving on quiet feet about the table, putting
things to rights. She had finished her part of the
argument. She was resolutely putting out of her mind
the things her sister had just said, and refusing altogether
to think of Herbert. She knew in her heart just
how Herbert had looked when he had said those things,
even to the snarl at the corner of his nose. She knew,
too, that Ellen had probably not reported the message
even so disagreeably as the original, and she knew that
it would be better to forget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ellen, rising after a long perusal, laying
the paper on the table, &ldquo;that sounds all very well in
writing. The thing is to see how it comes out. The
proof of the pudding is in the eating, and you needn&rsquo;t
tell me that any man in his senses will pay all that
salary merely for a &lsquo;chaperon,&rsquo; as he calls it. If he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
does, he&rsquo;s a fool; that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got to say. But I suppose
nothing short of getting caught in a trap will make
you see it; so I better save my breath. I&rsquo;m sure I
hope you won&rsquo;t go to the poorhouse through your
stubbornness. I&rsquo;ve done all I could to keep you from
it, and it&rsquo;s pretty hard to have my only sister leave me&ndash;&ndash;so
soo-oo-on after mother&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ellen,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud, looking at her
speculatively, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I never dreamed you cared
about having me away from here. You&rsquo;ve never shown
much interest in being with me. But I&rsquo;m sorry if
you feel it that way, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll write to you
and try to do little things for the children often,
now that I shall have something to do with.&rdquo; But her
kindly feeling was cut short by Ellen interrupting her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t trouble yourself! We can look
after the children ourselves. You better save what
you get to look after yourself when those two get over
this whim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then to her great relief Julia Cloud heard the
car returning from the station, and the two young
people rushing into the hall.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up-stairs to put on that calico wrapper
you loaned me, Aunt Jewel,&rdquo; shouted Leslie,
putting a rosy face into the dining-room for an
instant and then vanishing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bought a pair of overalls at the store, as you
suggested, Cloudy,&rdquo; put in Allison, waving a pair of
blue jeans at her and vanishing also.</p>
<p>Ellen Robinson stood mopping her eyes and staring
out from the dining-room window&ndash;&ndash;not at the hills&ndash;&ndash;and
sniffing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you&rsquo;d stop them calling you that
ridiculous name!&rdquo; she snorted. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t respectful.
It sounds like making fun of the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Ellen Robinson! She had her good points, but
a sense of humor wasn&rsquo;t one of them. Also it went
against the grain to give up her own way, and she
couldn&rsquo;t remember when she hadn&rsquo;t planned for the
freedom she would have when Julia came to live with
her. Having an entirely different temperament from
Julia&rsquo;s and no spiritual outlook whatever on life, she
was unable to understand what thraldom she had been
preparing and planning for her patient elder sister.
A little of this perhaps penetrated to Julia Cloud&rsquo;s disturbed
consciousness as she watched her sister&rsquo;s irate
back; for, when she spoke again, it was in a gentle,
soothing tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now, Ellen, let&rsquo;s forget it all, and just put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
it away. I shall be coming back to see you now and
then, perhaps, and you can come and see me. That&rsquo;ll
be something new to look forward to. Suppose now
we just get to work and see what&rsquo;s to be done. Have
you decided what you want to have taken over to
the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is doubtful whether Ellen would have succumbed
so easily, had not the two young people returned just
then and demanded that they have something to do.</p>
<p>As quietly as if she were used to packing and moving
every year of her life, Julia Cloud gave them each a
pile of newspapers, and set them to wrapping and packing
dishes in a big barrel; and Ellen was forced to
join in and say what she wanted to have of her
mother&rsquo;s things.</p>
<p>Without a word Julia set aside anything Ellen asked
for, even when it was something she would have liked
to keep herself; and Ellen, her lips pursed and her
eyes bright with defeat, went from room to room,
picking and choosing as if she were at an auction.</p>
<p>Allison still in overalls rushed out in the car, and
got a man with a moving-wagon; and before twelve
o&rsquo;clock Ellen Robinson saw a goodly load of household
furniture start for her own home; and, being somewhat
anxious as to how it would be disposed on its
arrival, she took the car, and sped away to placate
Herbert. She really felt quite triumphant at the ease
with which she had secured several valuable pieces of
mahogany which she knew had always been favorites
with Julia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; said Allison as the car vanished out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
sight, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t Aunt Ellen some depressor? Was she
always so awfully grown up? I say, Cloudy, you won&rsquo;t
get that way, will you when we get you off in our house?
If you do, take poison, or get married, or something.
Say, Cloudy Jewel, you&rsquo;re twenty years younger than
she is, do you know it? Now what&rsquo;ll I do next? That
closet is all empty. Shall I begin on this one? You
want this barrel up in the attic, you say? All right;
here goes! No, I won&rsquo;t hurt my back; I&rsquo;m strong as a
horse. I know how to lift things without hurting
myself. Open that door, Leslie, and move that chair
out of my way. Which corner shall I stow it, Cloudy?
Southwest? All right!&rdquo; and he vanished up the stairs
with his barrel.</p>
<p>At half-past twelve a man and a woman arrived
whom Julia Cloud had hired to help; and the house was
like a busy hive, not a drone among them. It really
was wonderful how short a time it took to dismantle
a home that had been running for years. But the
hands were wonderfully eager that took hold of the
work, and they went at things with a will. Moreover,
Julia Cloud&rsquo;s domain was always in perfect order,
which made a big difference.</p>
<p>They ate their lunch from the pantry shelf, because
Ellen had taken the dining-room table. But it was a
good lunch, bread and butter, apple butter, cookies, half
a custard pie, and glasses of rich, foamy milk. Then
they went to work again. The children were smudged
with dust and tumbled and happy. They were doing
real things for the first time in their lives, and they
liked it. Moreover, they were bringing to pass a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
beloved plan that had seemed at first impossible; and
they wanted to hustle it through before anything
spoiled or delayed it. There was Aunt Ellen. There
was no telling what she might not do to hinder, and
Julia Cloud was easily troubled by her sister, they
could see that, wise children that they were; so they
worked with all their might and main.</p>
<p>Two more men were requisitioned, and the furniture
began a steady march up to the attic, where it
was to be stored.</p>
<p>Leslie developed a talent for finding the place
where she was most needed and getting to work. She
put the sideboard drawers in order, and then went
to packing away garments from the closets in drawers
and trunks and chests, until by four o&rsquo;clock a great
many little nooks and corners in the house were absolutely
clear and empty, ready for the cleaning before
the new tenants arrived, although, to tell the truth,
there was scarcely a spot in Julia Cloud&rsquo;s house that
needed much cleaning, because it had always been
kept immaculate.</p>
<p>When Ellen Robinson in her car arrived in sight
of the house at half-past four she identified the parlor
and dining-room carpets hanging on a line strung
across the back yard, and two bedroom carpets being
beaten in the side yard. Mrs. Perkins from her patient
watch-tower had also identified them, and hurried
out to greet her friend and get more accurate information;
but Ellen was in too much of a hurry to get
inside and secure several other articles, which she had
thought of and desired to have, to spend much time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
in gossip. Besides, if Julia was really going, it was
just as well to make as much of it as possible; so she
greeted Mrs. Perkins as one too busy with important
affairs to tell details, and hurried into the house. Standing
within the old hallway, she gazed about, startled.
How on earth had Julia managed to tear up things
in such a hurry? The pictures had all vanished from
the walls. The books were gone from the old book-case;
the furniture itself was being carried away, the
marble-topped table being the last piece left. The
woman was washing the parlor floor, slopping on the
soapy water with that air of finality that made Ellen
Robinson realize that the old home was broken up at
last. Grimly she walked into the dining-room, and saw
immaculate empty closets and cleanly shining window-panes.
As far as the work had progressed it had been
done thoroughly.</p>
<p>Up-stairs a cheery chatter came from the rooms,
and Ellen Robinson experienced a pang of real jealousy
of these two young things who had swept in and carried
her neglected sister by storm. Somehow it seemed
to her that they had taken something that belonged to
her, and she began to feel bereft. Julia ought to love
her better than these two young strangers; why didn&rsquo;t
she? Why didn&rsquo;t those two children make such a fuss
over her as they did over Julia? It certainly was
strange! Perhaps some gleam of perception that it
might all be her own fault began to filter to Ellen
Robinson&rsquo;s consciousness as she stood there on the
stairs and listened to the pleasant chatter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Cloudy, dear! Is this really Daddy&rsquo;s picture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
when he was a little boy? What a funny collar and
necktie! But wasn&rsquo;t he a darling? I love the way
his hair curls around his face. I can remember Daddy
quite well. Mother used to say he was a wonderful
man. I think he must have been a good deal like you.
Our old nurse used to say that families went in streaks.
I guess you and Daddy were off the same streak,
weren&rsquo;t you? I hope Allison and I will be, too. Say,
Cloudy, can&rsquo;t I have this picture of Daddy to hang in
my room in our new house? I love it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen Robinson wondered whether they had classified
her as another &ldquo;streak,&rdquo; and somehow the thought
was unpleasant. It was like one of those little rare
mirrors that flash us a look now and then in which we
&ldquo;see oursel&rsquo;s as ithers see us,&rdquo; and are warned to take
account of stock. As she climbed the old stairs, Ellen
Robinson took account of herself, as it were, and resolved
to show a better side to these children than she
had shown heretofore; and so, when she appeared
among them, she put aside her grim aspect for a while,
and spoke in quite an affable tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you certainly can work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The contrast was so great that both the young
people blinked at her in wonder, and a smile broke out
on Leslie&rsquo;s lovely face. Somehow it warmed Aunt
Ellen&rsquo;s heart, and she went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you all must be tired. You better come up to
our house for supper to-night. You won&rsquo;t have any
chance to get it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we don&rsquo;t mind picnicking,&rdquo; said Leslie hastily.
Then she caught a glimpse of her aunt&rsquo;s face, and her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
natural kindliness came to the front. &ldquo;But of course
that would be lovely if it won&rsquo;t be too much trouble
for you,&rdquo; she added pleasantly with one of her brilliant
smiles, although she could see Allison making violent
motions and shaking his head at her from the other
room, where he was out of his Aunt Ellen&rsquo;s sight.
Leslie really had a lovely nature, and was always quick
to discern it when she had hurt any one. Ellen
Robinson looked at her suspiciously, alert for the insult
always, but yielded suddenly and unexpectedly to the
girl&rsquo;s loveliness. Was it something in Leslie&rsquo;s eyes that
reminded Ellen of her big brother who used to come
home now and then, and tease her, and bring her lovely
gifts? She watched Leslie a moment wistfully, and
then with a sigh turned away. She wished one of her
little girls could look like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d better go right home and get supper
ready,&rdquo; she said alertly; and there was a note of almost
pleased eagerness in her voice that she was included
in this function of packing and moving that seemed
somehow to have turned into a delightful game in which
weariness and care were forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have supper ready to dish up by seven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo;
she admonished her astonished sister as she swept past
the bedroom where she was at work putting away blankets
and pillows in camphor. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be ready
much before that; but don&rsquo;t you be a minute later, or
the supper will be spoiled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By which admonition Julia Cloud became aware
that Ellen was going to favor them with some of her
famous chicken potpie. She stood still for a whole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
minute with a light in her eyes and a smile on her face,
listening to Ellen&rsquo;s retreating footsteps down the stairs;
then, as the Ford set up its churning clatter, she turned
back to her task, and murmured softly, &ldquo;Poor Ellen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The supper passed off very well. Herbert was a
trifle gruff and silent; but it was plain that Allison&rsquo;s
stories amused him, for now and then a half-smile crept
into his stolid countenance. Julia Cloud was so glad
that she could have cried. She hated scenes, and she
dreaded being at outs with her relatives. So she ate
her chicken potpie and fresh pumpkin-pie thankfully,
and forgot how weary she was. After supper Leslie
sat down at the piano, and rattled off rag-time; and
she and Allison sang song after song, while the children
stood about admiringly, and even Herbert sat by as at
a social function and listened. The atmosphere was
really quite clear when at last they prepared to leave,
and Julia Cloud had an inkling that the big blue car
had something to do with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s some car you&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo; said Herbert patronizingly
as he held a lantern for them to get down the
steps. &ldquo;Get it this year? What do you have to pay
for that make now? I&rsquo;m thinking of getting a new one
myself pretty soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down upon their knees in the lantern-light went
the two men of the party, examining this and that point
of interest, their noses turned to the mysterious inner
workings of the wonderful mechanism, while Julia
Cloud sat and marveled that here at last was something
which Herbert Robinson respected.</p>
<p>And Ellen stood upon the steps, really smiling and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
saying how nice it had been to have them, for all the
world as if they were company, all the hard lines of
her rapidly maturing face softened by kindliness! It
seemed like a miracle. Julia Cloud settled back into the
deep cushions, and lifted her eyes to the dark line of
the hills against the sky. &ldquo;From whence cometh my
help,&rdquo; trailed the words through her tired brain; and
her heart murmured, &ldquo;God, I thank Thee!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>
<p>They all slept very late the next morning, being
utterly worn out from the unaccustomed work;
and, when they finally got down-stairs, they
took a sort of a lunch-breakfast off the pantry shelves
again. It was strange how good even shredded-wheat
biscuit and milk can taste when one has been working
hard and has a young appetite, although Leslie and
Allison had been known to scorn all cereals. Still,
there were cookies and wonderful apples from the big
tree in the back yard for dessert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are those men coming back to finish up?&rdquo;
suddenly demanded Leslie, poising a glass of milk and
a cooky in one hand and taking a great bite from
her apple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not till to-morrow,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud, looking
around the empty kitchen speculatively, and wondering
how in the world she was going to cook with all the
cooking-utensils packed in the attic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to have left the kitchen till last,&rdquo; she
added with a troubled look. &ldquo;You crazy children!
Didn&rsquo;t you know we had to eat? I told that man not to
take any of those things on the kitchen-table, that
they were to stay down until the very last thing, and
now he has taken the table even! I went up-stairs to
see if I could get at things, and I find he has put them
away at the back, and piled all the chairs and some
bed-springs in front of them. I&rsquo;m afraid we shall have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
to get some things out again. I don&rsquo;t see how we can
get along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it, Cloudy!&rdquo; said Leslie, giving a
spring and perching herself on the drain-board of the
sink, where she sat swinging her dainty little pumps
as nonchalantly as if she were sitting on a velvet sofa.
&ldquo;See! Here&rsquo;s my plan. I woke up early, and thought
it all out. Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; consulting her wee wrist-watch,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s nine o&rsquo;clock. That isn&rsquo;t bad. Now we&rsquo;ll work
till twelve; that&rsquo;s long enough for to-day, because you
got too tired yesterday; and, besides, we&rsquo;ve got some
other things to attend to. Then we&rsquo;ll hustle into the
car, and get to town, and do some shopping ready for
our trip. That will rest you. We&rsquo;ll get lunch at a
tea-room, and shop all the afternoon. We&rsquo;ll go to a
hotel for dinner, and stay all night. Then in the morning
we can get up early, have our breakfast, and drive
back here in time before the men come. Now isn&rsquo;t
that perfectly spick-and-span for a plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leslie! But, dear, that would cost a lot! And,
besides, it isn&rsquo;t in the least necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cost has nothing to do with it. Look!&rdquo; and
Leslie flourished a handful of bills. &ldquo;See what Guardy
Lud gave me! And Allison has another just like it.
He said particularly that we were not to let you get all
worked out and get sick so you couldn&rsquo;t go with us, and
he particularly told us about a lot of things he wanted
us to buy to make things easy on the way. After
he leaves us and goes back to California we&rsquo;re in your
charge, I know; but just now you&rsquo;re in ours, you dear,
unselfish darling; and we&rsquo;re going to run you. Oh,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
we&rsquo;re going to run you to beat the band!&rdquo; laughed
Leslie, and jumped down from her perch to hug and
squeeze the breath out of Julia Cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But child! Dear!&rdquo; said that good woman when
she could get her breath to speak. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t begin
in that extravagant way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they put their hands over her lips, and laughed
away her protests until she had to give up for laughing
with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; she said at last, when they had subsided
from a regular rough-house frolic for all the
world as if they were children, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to get to
work in good earnest; only it doesn&rsquo;t seem right to let
you work so hard when you are visiting me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Visiting, nothing!&rdquo; declared Allison; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
having the time of our lives. I haven&rsquo;t been in a place
where I could do as I pleased since I was eight years
old. This is real work, and I like it. Come now,
don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s waste any time. What can I do first?
Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to have me take down all the pictures
on the second floor, stack them in the attic, and
sweep down the walls the way we did down
here yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said their aunt with an affectionate homage
in her eyes for this dear, capable boy who was so eager
over everything as if it were his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And those big bookcases. What are you going
to do with the books? Do you want any of them to go
with you, or are they to be packed away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t take any of those books. They&rsquo;ll
need to be dusted and put in boxes. There are a lot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
of boxes in the cellar, and there&rsquo;s a pile of papers to
use for lining the boxes. But you&rsquo;ll have your hands
full with the pictures, I think. Let the books go till
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison went whistling up-stairs, and began taking
down the pictures; but anybody could see by the set of
his shoulders that he meant to get the books out of the
way too before noon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what can I do?&rdquo; said Leslie, whirling
around from wiping the last cup and plate they had
used. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one more bureau besides yours. Does
it need emptying out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear. That has your grandmother&rsquo;s things in
it, and is in perfect order. She had me fix up the things
several months ago. Everything is tied up and labelled.
I don&rsquo;t think we need to disturb it. The men can move
it up as it is. But we need to get the rest of the bed-clothes
out on the line for an airing before I pack them
away in the chest up-stairs. You might do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Leslie went back and forth, carrying blankets
and quilts, and hanging them on the line, till Mrs.
Perkins had to come over to see what was going on.
She came with a cup in her hand to ask for some baking-powder,
and Julia Cloud gave her the whole box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you needn&rsquo;t return it,&rdquo; she said, smiling. &ldquo;I
shall not need it. I&rsquo;ve rented the house, and am going
away for a while.&rdquo; Mrs. Perkins was so astonished
that she actually went home without finding out where
Julia Cloud was going, and had to come back to see
whether there was anything she could do to help, in
order to get a chance to ask.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></div>
<p>It was really quite astonishing what a lot could
be done in three hours. When twelve o&rsquo;clock came,
the two children descended upon their aunt with insistence
that she wash her hands and put on her hat.
The rooms had assumed that cleared-up, ready look
that rests the tired worker just to look around and
see what has been accomplished. With a conviction
that she was being quite a child to run away this way
when there was still a lot to be done, but with an overwhelming
desire to yield to the pressure, Julia
Cloud surrendered.</p>
<p>When she came down-stairs five minutes later in
her neat black suit and small black hat with the mourning
veil about it that Ellen had insisted upon for the
funeral, the car was already at the door, and she felt
almost guilty as she locked the door and went down the
path. But the beauty of the day intoxicated her at once,
and she forgot immediately everything but the joy of
riding out into the world.</p>
<p>Leslie was a bit quiet as they glided down the road
out of town, and kept eyeing her aunt silently. At last,
as Julia Cloud was calling attention to a wonderful
red woodbine that had twined itself about an old dead
tree and was setting the roadside ablaze with splendor,
Leslie caught her eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, dear? Does something trouble you?
Is anything wrong with me?&rdquo; asked Julia Cloud, putting
up a prospecting hand to her hair and hat.</p>
<p>Leslie&rsquo;s cheeks went rosy red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Cloudy, dear,&rdquo; said Leslie, &ldquo;I was just wondering.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
But I&rsquo;m afraid to say it. Maybe it will make
you feel bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit, deary; what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Cloudy, do you think Grandmother
would care very much if you didn&rsquo;t wear black? Do
you like it yourself, or feel it wouldn&rsquo;t be right not
to wear it? I don&rsquo;t mean any disrespect to Grandmother;
but oh, you would look so sweet in gray, gray
and lavender and soft pink, or just gray now for a
while. Are you very mad at me for saying it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud reached over and patted the young hand
that lay near her on the seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, dear! I&rsquo;m not mad, and I don&rsquo;t care
for black myself. I don&rsquo;t believe in wearing black for
the people who have left us and gone to heaven. It
seems to me white would be a great deal better. But
I put on these things to please Ellen. She thought it
would be showing great disrespect to mother if I didn&rsquo;t,
and rather than argue about it I did as she wanted
me to. But I don&rsquo;t intend to darken the place around
me by dressing in mourning, child; and I&rsquo;m glad you
don&rsquo;t want me to. I like bright, happy things. And,
besides, Leslie, dear, your grandmother was a bright,
happy woman herself once when she was young, before
she was sick and had trouble; and I like to remember her
that way, because I&rsquo;m sure that is the way she looks
now in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; sighed Leslie. &ldquo;That makes
the day just perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll wait until I get away to change, however,&rdquo;
said Julia Cloud thoughtfully. &ldquo;It would just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
annoy Ellen to do it now, and might make such people
as Mrs. Perkins say disagreeable things that would
make it unpleasant for your aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; said Leslie, nestling closer, her eyes
dancing with some secret plans of her own. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
all right, Cloudy. How dear and sort of &lsquo;understanding&rsquo;
you are, just like a real mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And somehow Julia Cloud felt as if she was entering
into a new world.</p>
<p>Allison seemed to know by intuition just where
to find the right kind of tea-room. He ushered them
into the place, and found a table in a secluded nook,
with a fountain playing nearby over ferns, and ivy
climbing over a mimic pergola. There were not many
people eating, for it was past one o&rsquo;clock. There were
little round tables with high-backed chairs that seemed
to shut them off in a corner by themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is nice!&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a real family
now, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; and he looked over at Julia Cloud
with that fine homage that now and then a boy just
entering manhood renders to an older woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Creamed chicken on toast, fruit-salad, toasted
muffins, and ice-cream with hot chocolate sauce,&rdquo;
ordered Allison after studying the menu-card for a
moment. &ldquo;You like all those, don&rsquo;t you, Cloudy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but my dear! You mustn&rsquo;t order all that.
A sandwich is all I need. Just a tongue sandwich.
You must not begin by being extravagant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my party, Cloudy. This goes under the
head of expenses. If you can&rsquo;t find enough you like
among what I order, why, I&rsquo;ll get you a tongue sandwich,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
too; but you&rsquo;ve been feeding us out of the cooky-jar,
and I guess I&rsquo;ll get the finest I can find to pay you
back. I told you this was my time. When we get
settled, you can order things; but now I&rsquo;m going
to see that you get enough to eat while you&rsquo;re working
so hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie&rsquo;s eyes danced with her dimples as Julia Cloud
appealed to her to stop this extravagance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Cloudy. I heard Guardy Lud
tell Al not to spare any expense to make things comfortable
for you while you were moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Julia Cloud settled down to the pleasure of a
new and delicious combination of foods, and thoroughly
enjoyed it all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Leslie as the meal drew to a close,
&ldquo;we must get to work. It&rsquo;s half-past two, and the
stores close at half-past five. I&rsquo;ve a lot of shopping
to do. How about you, Cloudy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must buy a trunk,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud thoughtfully,
&ldquo;and a hand-bag and some gloves. I ought to
get a new warm coat, but that will do later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie eyed her thoughtfully, and raised one brow
intensively at her brother as she rose from the table.</p>
<p>Allison landed them at a big department store, and
guided his aunt to the trunk department with instructions
to stay there until he and Leslie came back. Then
they went off with great glee and many whisperings.</p>
<p>It is a curious thing how easily and quickly young
people can shop provided they have plenty of money
and no older person by to hamper them. Allison and
Leslie were back within the time they had set, looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
very meek and satisfied. Leslie carried a small package,
which she laid in Julia Cloud&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you needed a hand-bag,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and
I came on a place where they were having a sale. I
thought this was a peach; so I bought it. If you don&rsquo;t
like it, we can give it to Aunt Ellen or some one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud&rsquo;s cheeks grew pink with pleasure, and
she felt like a very young, happy child as she opened
the parcel to find a lovely gray su&egrave;de hand-bag with
silver clasp and fittings, containing quite a little outfit
of toilet articles and brushes in neat, compact form.
She caught her breath with delight as she touched the
soft white leather lining, and noticed the perfection
and finish of the whole. It seemed fit for a queen,
yet was plain and quiet enough on the outside for a
dove to carry. She looked up to see the two pairs
of eager eyes upon her, and could hardly refrain from
throwing her arms about the children right there in
the store; but she stopped in time and let her eyes do the
caressing, as she said with a tremble in her low,
sweet voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O you dear children! How you are going to
spoil me! I see I must get settled quickly so that I
shall have the power to restrain you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rollicked forth then, and bought several
things, a big steamer rug for the car, a pair of long
gray mocha gloves to match the hand-bag, a silk
umbrella, and for Aunt Ellen a shiny black hand-bag
with a number of conveniences in it, and a pair of new
black gloves with long, warm wrists tucked inside of
it. Then Allison thoughtfully suggested a handsome
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
leather wallet for Uncle Herbert, and Julia Cloud lingered
by the handkerchief-counter, and selected half
a dozen new fine handkerchiefs. It all seemed just like
a play to her, it was so very long since she had been
shopping herself. Ellen had bought everything for her
for years, because she was always too busy or too burdened
to get away.</p>
<p>When they were out in the street again, it was still
too early to think of going to the hotel for dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about a movie, Cloudy?&rdquo; asked Allison
shyly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a pippin down the street a ways.
I saw it as we came by. Or don&rsquo;t you like movies?
Perhaps you&rsquo;d rather go to the hotel and lie down. I
suppose you are maybe worn out. I ought to have
thought of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it!&rdquo; said the game little woman. &ldquo;I
should love to go. Maybe you won&rsquo;t believe it, but I
never went to a movie in my life, and I&rsquo;ve been wanting
to know what they were like for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never went to a movie in your life! Why,
Cloudy, you poor dear!&rdquo; said Allison, who had been
fairly fed on movies. &ldquo;Why, how did it happen?
Don&rsquo;t they have moving pictures in your town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they have them now, though only a year or
so ago. But you know I&rsquo;ve never been able to get away,
even if they had been all about me. Besides, I suppose
I should have been considered crazy if I had gone,
me, an oldish woman! If there had been children to
take, it would have been different. I suppose it is a
childish desire, but I always loved pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; said Allison. &ldquo;Get in quick,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
and I&rsquo;ll have you there before you say Jack Robinson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so in the restful cool of a flower-laden atmosphere
in one of the finest moving-picture places in the
city Julia Cloud sat with her two children and saw
her first moving picture, holding her breath in wonder
and delight as the people on the screen lived and moved
before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m having too good a time,&rdquo; she said
quietly as she settled back in the car again, and was
whirled away to the hotel. &ldquo;I feel as if I were a child
again. If this keeps on, I won&rsquo;t have dignity enough
left to chaperon you properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but Cloudy, dear, that&rsquo;s just why we want
you, because you know how to be young and play with
us,&rdquo; clamored both of them together.</p>
<p>Then after a good dinner they went up to their
rooms, and there was Julia Cloud&rsquo;s shining new trunk
that had to be looked over; and there on the floor
beside it stood two packages, big boxes, both of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be a mistake,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud, looking
at them curiously. &ldquo;Allison, you better call the boy
and have him take them away to the right room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison picked up the top package, a big, square box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this is your name, Cloudy Jewel!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;It must be yours. Open it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could it be?&rdquo; said Julia Cloud
perplexedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open it, Cloudy. I want to see what&rsquo;s in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud was bending over the long pasteboard
box on the floor and finding her name on that, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very strange,&rdquo; she said, her cheeks beginning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
to grow pink like those of a child on her first Christmas
morning. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s some more of your extravagant
capers. I don&rsquo;t know what I shall do with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her eager fingers untied the string, while Leslie
and Allison executed little silent dances around the
room and tried to stifle their mirth.</p>
<p>The cover fell off at last, and the tissue-paper blew
up in a great fluff; and out of it rolled a beautiful long,
soft, thick gray cloak of finest texture and silken lining,
with a great puffy collar and cuffs of deep, soft silver-gray
fox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h!&rdquo; was all Julia Cloud could say as the
wonderful garment slipped out and spread about over
the box and floor. And then the two children caught it
up, and enveloped her in it, buttoning it down the front
and turning the collar around her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s yours, Cloudy, to keep you warm on the journey!&rdquo;
cried Leslie, dancing around and clapping her
hands. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she look lovely in it, Allison? Oh,
isn&rsquo;t she dear?&rdquo; and Leslie caught her and whirled her
around the room.</p>
<p>Then Allison brought the big square box, and demanded
that it be opened; and out of it came a small
gray hat in soft silky beaver, with a close gray feather
curled quietly about it, that settled down on Julia
Cloud&rsquo;s lovely white hair as if it had been made for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind, do you, Cloudy, dear? You
don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m officious or impertinent?&rdquo; begged Leslie
anxiously. &ldquo;It was Allison&rsquo;s idea to get the hat to
match the coat, and it was such a dear we couldn&rsquo;t help
taking it; but, if there is anything about them you don&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
like, we got special permission for you to exchange
them to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud settled down in a chair, and looked at
herself in helpless joy and admiration. Like them!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But O children! You oughtn&rsquo;t to have got such
wonderful, expensive things for me. I&rsquo;m just a plain,
simple woman, you know, and it&rsquo;s not fitting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there arose a great clamor about her. Why
was it not fitting? She who had given her life for
others, why should she not have some of the beautiful,
comfortable things of earth? It wasn&rsquo;t sensible for her
to talk that way. That was being too humble. And,
besides, weren&rsquo;t these things quite sensible and practical?
Weren&rsquo;t they warm, and wouldn&rsquo;t they be convenient
and comfortable and neat? Well, then, &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo;
finished Allison.</p>
<p>And so at last they said &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; and went
to their beds; but long after the children were asleep
Julia Cloud lay awake and thought it out. God had
been good to her, and was leading her into green pastures
beside quiet waters; but there were things He was
expecting of her, and was she going to be able to fulfil
them? These two young souls were hers to guide.
Would she have the grace to guide them into the knowledge
of God in Christ? And then she lay praying for
strength for this great work until the peace of God&rsquo;s
sleep dropped down upon her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>
<p>The next two days were busy ones. There were
a great many last little things to be done, and
Julia Cloud would have worked herself out,
had not the children interfered and carried her off for
a ride every little while. The intervening Sabbath was
spent at Ellen Robinson&rsquo;s. The handsome hand-bag
and wallet served to keep Ellen from being very disagreeable.
In fact, at the last, when she began to
realize that Julia was really going away, and would not
be down at the old house any more for her to burden
and torment, she really revealed a gleam of affection
for her, and quite worried poor Julia with thinking
that perhaps, after all, she ought not to go away so
far from her only sister. When Ellen sat down on the
bare stairs in the old hall Monday morning, and gave
vent to a real sob at parting, Julia had a swift vision
of her little sister years ago sitting on that same stair
weeping from a fall, and herself comforting her; and
she put her arms around Ellen, and kissed her for the
first time in many reticent years.</p>
<p>But at last they were off, having handed over the
keys to the new tenant, and Julia Cloud leaned back on
the luxurious cushions and laughed. Not from mirth,
for there were tears in her eyes; and not from nervousness,
for she was never subject to hysteria; but just
from sheer excitement and joy to think that she was
really going out in the world at last to see things and
live a life of her own.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></div>
<p>The two young people felt it, and laughed with her,
until the blackbirds, swirling in a rustling chorus overhead
on their way south, seemed to be joining in, and a
little squirrel whisked across the road and sat up inquiringly
on a log framed in scarlet leaves.</p>
<p>They went straight to the city, for Mr. Luddington
had promised to meet them there and confer with them
further about their plans. But, when they reached the
hotel, they found only a telegram from him saying
that business had held him longer than he expected
and that he should have to arrange to meet them
farther along in their journey. He suggested three
colleges, either one of which he should favor, and outlined
their journey to take in a stop at each. He promised
to communicate with them later, and gave his own
address in case they decided to remain at either the
first or the second place visited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud after the telegram was
disposed of, &ldquo;I want to get a new dress and a few
things before we go any farther. I know you children
don&rsquo;t like these old black things, and we might
as well start out right. It won&rsquo;t take me long, and
I shall be ready to go on my way right after lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie was delighted, and the two spent two hours
of happiness in shopping, while Allison drove to a
garage to have his car looked over thoroughly, and
laid in a supply of good things for the journey. He
also spent a profitable half-hour studying a road-map
and asking questions concerning the journey.</p>
<p>They tried to make Julia Cloud take a nap before
they started, but she declared she would rather rest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
in the car; and so they started off, feeling like three
children going to find the end of the rainbow.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful afternoon. The air was like
wine, and the autumn foliage was in all its glory. As
they flew along, it seemed as if they were leaving all
care behind. A soft pink color grew in Julia Cloud&rsquo;s
cheeks, and she sat with her hands folded and her eyes
bright with the beauty of the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you&rsquo;re a beauty, Cloudy, dear!&rdquo; exclaimed
Leslie suddenly. &ldquo;See her, Allison! Just look
at her. Isn&rsquo;t she great? She was all right in those
black things, of course, but she&rsquo;s wonderful in the
gray things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Julia Cloud had laid aside in the very bottom
of her new trunk the prim black serge that Ellen had
bought, and the black funeral gloves and coat and hat;
and she was wearing a lovely soft gray wool jersey
dress with white collar and cuffs. The big gray coat
was nestled by her side ready for use when the wind
grew colder, and she was wearing the new gray hat
and gloves, and looked a lady every inch. Allison
turned slowly, and gave her a look that made her blush
like a girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say she <i>is</i> great! She&rsquo;s a peach!&rdquo; he
agreed. &ldquo;That hat is a cracker jack! It looks like a
pigeon&rsquo;s wing. I like it; don&rsquo;t you, Cloudy? But say,
Leslie, she&rsquo;s something more than a beauty. She&rsquo;s a
good scout. That&rsquo;s what she is. Do you realize she
hasn&rsquo;t opened her lips about the car once? &rsquo;Member
the time I took Mrs. Luddington down to the office
for Guardy, how she squeaked every time another car
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
went by, and cautioned me to be careful and go slow,
and asked me how many times I had ever driven before,
and if I wasn&rsquo;t exceeding the speed-limit, and no end
of things? But Cloudy hasn&rsquo;t batted an eye. She
just sits there as if she was riding a cloud and enjoyed
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud, laughing; &ldquo;and
I never thought of being afraid. I didn&rsquo;t know enough
to. Ought I to? Because I&rsquo;m having such a good
time that I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;d forget to be frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said. You&rsquo;re a good sport. I
believe you like to go fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud admitted shamedly that she did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a splendid driver, and so am I,&rdquo; Leslie explained
earnestly. &ldquo;Guardy had us taught ages ago,
and we&rsquo;re driven a lot; only of course we didn&rsquo;t have
our own car. We just had the regular car that belongs
to the house. But we made that work some. And
Allison took a full course in cars. He knows how to
repair them, and put them together, and everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I let her go, Cloudy?&rdquo; asked Allison eagerly.
&ldquo;Will you be afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should love it,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud eagerly, and
then with a sober look at the boy: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything
crazy, dear! Don&rsquo;t do anything that you oughtn&rsquo;t
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; said Allison gravely, sitting up
with a manly look in his handsome young face. And
by the look he gave her she knew that she had put him
upon his honor, and she knew that he would take no
risks now that she had trusted him. If she had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
a squealing, hectoring kind of woman, he might have
been challenged into taking risks, but not here, when
she trusted him and the responsibility was all his.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud, as she drew a long breath and prepared,
to enjoy the flight down the white ribbon of road, up
a hill and down another, registered the thought that
here was a clew to this boy&rsquo;s character. Trust him, and
he would be faithful. Distrust him, and you wouldn&rsquo;t
be anywhere. It did not come to her in words that
way, but rather as a subconscious fact that was incorporated
into her soul, and gave her a solid and sure
feeling about her boy. She had seen all that in his eyes.</p>
<p>He turned around presently, and told her how fast
they had been going; and her eyes were shining as
brightly as Leslie&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pretty good pard, Cloudy,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make you a member of the gang and take you
everywhere. See! You&rsquo;re being initiated now, and
you&rsquo;re making good right along. I knew we did a good
thing when we came after you. Didn&rsquo;t we, Les?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Leslie turned and flung herself into Julia
Cloud&rsquo;s arms with one of her enthusiastic hugs.</p>
<p>It was just evening when they entered the little
town about twenty miles from a larger city, where was
located a seat of learning, co-educational, which had
been highly recommended to Mr. Luddington, and
which seemed to him to have a great many good points
in its favor.</p>
<p>The sign-posts warned them of their approach; and
the three sat silently watching, judging the place from
the outskirts. Big square houses and lawns multiplied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
as they progressed. Some streets had fences. Substantial
churches rose here and there, and the college
grounds became visible as they neared the centre of the
town. The buildings were spacious and attractive,
with tall old elms and maples shading the broad walks.
There was an ideal chapel of dark-red stone with arches
and a wonderful belfry, and one could easily imagine
young men and maidens flitting here and there.</p>
<p>The two young people studied the scene as the car
drove slowly by, and said nothing. Allison went on
to the other end of town till the houses grew farther
apart, and nothing had been said. Then Leslie drew
a big sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn around, brother, and let&rsquo;s go back past
there again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison turned around, and drove slowly by the
college grounds again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are tennis-courts at the back,&rdquo; said Leslie,
&ldquo;and that looks like a gym over there. Do you suppose
that&rsquo;s the athletic field over at the back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drove slowly around the block, and Julia
Cloud sat silently, trying to think of herself in this
strange environment, and feeling suddenly chilly and
alone. There would be a lot of strange people to meet,
and the children would be off at college all day. She
hadn&rsquo;t thought of that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try some of the side streets,&rdquo; ordered Leslie;
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen our house yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came to the business part of the town, and
found the stopping-place suggested in Mr. Luddington&rsquo;s
directions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t tell much about it to-night,&rdquo; said Allison
gravely. &ldquo;I guess we better get some supper and
let Cloudy Jewel get rested for a while. Then to-morrow
we can look around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were wise words, and Julia Cloud assented at
once; but it was quite plain that neither he nor Leslie
was much elated at the place.</p>
<p>Allison slipped out for a walk through the college
grounds after the others had gone to their rooms, and
came back whistling gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t like it, Cloudy,&rdquo; whispered Leslie as
the sound floated in through the transom. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t
have anything to do with it. You see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so, dear? He&rsquo;s whistling.
That sounds as if he liked it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but look what he&rsquo;s whistling. He always begins
on &lsquo;The Long, Long Trail&rsquo; if he isn&rsquo;t pleased
or has to wait when he&rsquo;s in a hurry to get anywhere.
Now, if he had been pleased, you would have heard
&lsquo;One grasshopper hopped right over th&rsquo; other grasshopper&rsquo;s
back.&rsquo; I can always tell. Well, I don&rsquo;t care;
do you, Cloudy? There&rsquo;s plenty of other colleges, and
I didn&rsquo;t see our house in any of the streets we went
through, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud had to confess that she had not been
in love with anything she had seen yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, what&rsquo;s the use of going over the old
college? I say let&rsquo;s beat it in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Julia Cloud would not hear to that. She said
they must be fair even to a college, and Mr. Luddington
would want them to look the place over thoroughly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
while they were there. So after breakfast the two
reluctant young people went with Julia Cloud to
make investigation.</p>
<p>They went through the classrooms and the chapel
and the library and gymnasiums. They visited the
science halls and workshops. They even climbed up
to the observatory, and took a squint at the big telescope,
and then they came down and went with a real-estate
dealer to see some houses. But at twelve o&rsquo;clock
they came back to their boarding-house with a sigh of
relief, ate a good dinner, and, climbing into their car,
shook the dust of the town, as it were, from their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be a very nice town, but it&rsquo;s not the
town for me,&rdquo; chanted Leslie, nestling back among
the cushions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, too!&rdquo; said Allison, letting the car ride out
under full power over the smooth country road. But,
though Julia Cloud questioned several times, she could
get no explanation except Allison&rsquo;s terse &ldquo;Too provincial,&rdquo;
whatever he meant by that. She doubted
whether he knew himself. She wondered whether it
were that they each felt the same homesick feeling that
she had experienced.</p>
<p>They stayed that night at a little country inn, and
started on their way again at early morning, for they
had a long journey before them to reach the second
place that Mr. Luddington had suggested. Late that
afternoon they stopped in a small city, and decided to
rest until morning; for the children wanted to stretch
their limbs, and they felt that their aunt was very weary
though she declared she was only sleepy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></div>
<p>The sun had quite gone down the next evening,
and the twilight was beginning to settle over everything
as they drove at last into the second college town of
their tour, and the church bells were pealing for prayer
meeting. Church bells! The thought of them sent a
thrill through Julia Cloud&rsquo;s heart. There was somehow
a familiar, home-like sound to them that made her
think of the prayer meetings that had cheered her heart
through many lonely days.</p>
<p>It had really been for many years her one outing
to go to prayer meeting. Even after her mother had
become bedridden she had always insisted on Julia&rsquo;s
going off to prayer meeting, and a neighbor who was
lame and sometimes stayed with her would come hobbling
in and send her off. The old cracked church bell
at home had always sounded sweet to her ears because
it meant that this hour was her own quiet time to go
away alone and rest. And it had been real heart-rest
always, even though sometimes the meetings themselves
had been wofully prosy. There had always been
the pleasant little chat and the warm hand-shake afterwards,
and then the going home again beneath the stars
with a bit of the last hymn in one&rsquo;s soul to sing one to
sleep with,</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;Nearer, my God, to Thee,<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Nearer to Thee;<br />
E&rsquo;en though it be a cross<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>That raiseth me;&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>and the burden had grown less, and her heart had
grown light with the promise of her Father. Those
meetings had been to Julia Cloud very real meetings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
with her Christ; and now, as the evening bells pealed
out, her heart leaped to meet and answer the call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;d like to go to prayer meeting!&rdquo; she said
impulsively as they passed the lighted church, and saw
a few faithful going in at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean it?&rdquo; asked Allison, bringing the
car to a stop. &ldquo;Do you <i>mean</i> it, Cloudy? Then let&rsquo;s
go. We can size the people up, and see if we like their
looks. I guess we can stand a prayer meeting unless
you are too tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the eagerness of a child Julia Cloud got out
of the car and went into the house of the Lord. It was
like a bit of heaven to her. She didn&rsquo;t realize what
a bore it might be to her two companions.</p>
<p>It was a good little meeting as such meetings go.
Very little enthusiasm, very few present, mostly elders
and their wives, with an old saint or two almost at the
journey&rsquo;s end, and a dignified white-haired minister,
who said some good things in a drony, sleepy tone. The
piano was played by a homely young woman who wore
unfashionable clothes, and made frightful mistakes in
the bass occasionally; but that did not seem to trouble
the singers, who sang with the heart rather than with
their voices.</p>
<p>Allison sat solemnly, and refrained from looking at
his sister; but both stole occasional glances at their
aunt, and admired her new clothes and the beautiful
light on her face. For Julia Cloud felt as if she were
glimpsing into heaven and seeing her Lord in this bit
of communion with some of His saints; and, when she
bowed her head in the closing prayer, she was thanking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
Him for all His mercies in bringing this wonderful
change into her gray life, and giving her these two
dear children to love her and be loved by her. As she
rose to come out, her face was glorified by that vision
on the mount.</p>
<p>The gentle-faced minister came and spoke to them,
and welcomed them to the church, although Allison told
him quite curtly that they were only passing through
the town; but Julia Cloud trod the neat brown ingrain
carpet of the aisle as if it were golden pavement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the stupid places!&rdquo; said Allison as they
got into the car. &ldquo;What do they have prayer
meetings for, anyway? Did you manage to keep
awake, Cloudy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And suddenly like a pall there fell upon Julia
Cloud&rsquo;s bright soul the realization that these children
did not, would not, feel as she did about such things.
They had probably never been taught to love the house
of God, and how was she ever to make them see?
Perhaps it had been prosy and dull to one who did not
hear the Lord&rsquo;s voice behind the Bible words. Perhaps
the old minister had been long and tiresome, and the
children were weary with the journey and sleepy; she
ought not to have let them stop now; and she began to
say how sorry she was. But, when they saw from her
words that she had really enjoyed that dull little meeting,
they were silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Cloudy, I&rsquo;ll hand it to you,&rdquo; said Allison
at last. &ldquo;If you could stand that meeting and enjoy
it, you&rsquo;re some Christian! But I&rsquo;m glad for one that
we went if you liked it; and I guess, if you can go a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
football game now and then, I ought to be able to stand
a prayer meeting. So now here goes for seeing the
town. It&rsquo;s only nine o&rsquo;clock, and I believe that&rsquo;s the
college up there on the hill where all those lights are.
Shall we drive up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car slipped through the pleasant evening streets,
turning a corner, slowing up at a crossing to take a
view of the town, and keeping all the time in view the
clusters of lights on the hill, which Allison conceived
to be the college. Suddenly Leslie leaned forward,
and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Allison, stop! Stop! There it is, just there
on the right. And it&rsquo;s for sale, too! Oh, let&rsquo;s get right
out and get the name of the agent, so we won&rsquo;t lose
it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison stopped the car suddenly, and turned to
look. There in the full blaze of an electric arc-light,
nestled among shrubbery and tall trees, with a smooth
terrace in front, was a beautiful little cottage of white
stone, with a pink roof, and windows everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s not the college, Les; what&rsquo;s the matter
with you?&rdquo; said Allison, putting his hand on the starter
again. &ldquo;Better wake up. Don&rsquo;t you know a college
when you don&rsquo;t see one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;College nothing!&rdquo; said his sister. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s our
house. That&rsquo;s our <i>home</i>, Allison. The very house I&rsquo;ve
dreamed of. It looks a little like the houses in California,
and it is the very thing. Now, there&rsquo;s no use;
you&rsquo;ve got to get out and get that agent&rsquo;s name, or
I&rsquo;ll jump out myself, and get lost, and walk the rest
of the way!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It is lovely!&rdquo; said Julia Cloud, leaning over to
look. &ldquo;But it looks expensive, and you wouldn&rsquo;t
want to <i>buy</i> a house, you know, dear; for you might
not stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we would if we liked it. And, besides,
houses can be sold again when you get done with them,
though I&rsquo;d never want to sell that! It&rsquo;s a perfect little
duck. Allison, will you get out or shall I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m game,&rdquo; said Allison, getting out and
jumping the hedge into the pretty yard.</p>
<p>He took out his pencil, and wrote down the address
in his note-book, stepped up the terrace and glanced
about, then went close to the street sign, and found out
what corner it was near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a pippin, sure thing,&rdquo; he said as he sprang
into the car again; &ldquo;but, Leslie, for the love of Mike,
don&rsquo;t find any more houses to-night! I&rsquo;m hungry as a
bear. That prayer meeting was one too many for
me; I&rsquo;m going to make for the nearest restaurant;
and then, if you want to go house-hunting after that, all
right; but I&rsquo;m going to find the eats first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They asked a group of boys where the restaurant
was, and one pointed to an open door from which light
was streaming forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the pie-shop,&rdquo; they said, and the party
descended hungry and happy with the delicious uncertainty
of having found a dream of a house in the dark,
and wondering what it would turn out to be in the
daytime. They inquired the way to the inn, and decided
to stop further investigations until morning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>
<p>They were all very weary, and slept well that
night; but, strange to say, Allison, who was
the sleepy-head, awoke first, and was out looking
the town over before the others had thought
of awaking. He came back to breakfast eager
and impatient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need to go any farther,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a peach of a place. There&rsquo;s a creek that reaches
up in the woods for miles; and they have canoes and
skating and a swimming-hole; and there are tennis-courts
everywhere; and it&rsquo;s only eleven miles from
the city. I say we just camp here, and not bother about
going on to the other place. I&rsquo;m satisfied. If that
house is big enough, it&rsquo;s just the thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But have you been to the college?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I asked about it. They have intercollegiate
games and frats, and I guess it&rsquo;s all right. It
has a peach of a campus, too, and a Carnegie library
with chimes&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but, dear, you aren&rsquo;t going to college just
for those things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the college&rsquo;ll be all right. Guardy wouldn&rsquo;t
have suggested it if it wasn&rsquo;t. But we&rsquo;ll go up there this
morning and look around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, children, don&rsquo;t get your heart set on it before
you know all about it. You know that house may be
quite impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Cloudy!&rdquo; put in Leslie. &ldquo;You know Allison
told you you were a good sport. You mustn&rsquo;t begin by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
preaching before you find out. If it isn&rsquo;t all right, why,
of course we don&rsquo;t want it; so let&rsquo;s have the fun of
thinking it is till we prove it isn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;or it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud looked into the laughing, happy eyes,
and yielded with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s reasonable. I&rsquo;m
agreed to that. But there&rsquo;s one thing: you know we&rsquo;re
bound to go on to the other college, because Mr.
Luddington expects us; and we can come back here
again if we like this better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can wire him to come here,&rdquo; said Leslie.
&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s go! First to that house, please, because
I&rsquo;m so afraid somebody will buy it before we get the
option on it. I&rsquo;ve heard that houses are very scarce
in the East just now, and people are snapping them up.
I read that on the back of that old man&rsquo;s paper at the
next table to ours this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All three of them having the hearts of children,
they went at once to hunt up the agent before ever
they got even a glimpse of the halls of learning standing
brave and fair on the hillside in the morning sunshine.
&ldquo;Because there are plenty more colleges,&rdquo; said Leslie;
&ldquo;but there is only one home for us, and I believe we&rsquo;ve
found it, if it looks half as pretty in the daylight as
it did at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took only a few minutes to find the agent and get
the key of the house, and presently they were standing
on the terrace gazing with delight at the house.</p>
<p>It was indeed a lovely little dwelling. It was built
of stone, and then painted white, but the roof and
gables were tiled with great pink tiles, giving an odd
little foreign look to it, something like Anne Hathaway&rsquo;s
cottage in general contour, Leslie declared.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>The top of the terrace was pink-tiled, too, and all
the porches were paved with tiles. The house itself
seemed filled with windows all around. Allison unlocked
the door, and they exclaimed with pleasure as
he threw it wide open and they stepped in. The sunshine
was flooding the great living-room from every
direction, it seemed. To begin with, the room was
very large, and gave the effect of being a sun-parlor
because of its white panelled walls and its many windows.
Straight across from the front door on the
opposite side of the room opened a small hallway or
passage with stairs leading up to a platform where
more windows shed a beautiful light down the stairs on
walls papered with strange tropical birds in delicate
old-fashioned tracery.</p>
<p>To the right through a wide white arch from the
living-room was a charming white dining-room with
little, high, leaded-paned windows over the spot for the
sideboard and long windows in front.</p>
<p>To the left was an enormous stone fireplace with
high mantel-shelf of stone and the chimney above.
The fire-opening was wide enough for an old Yule log,
and on either side of it were double glass doors opening
into a long porch room, which also had a fireplace on the
opposite side of the chimney, and was completely shut
in by long casement windows.</p>
<p>Up-stairs there were four large bedrooms and a
little hall room that could be used for a sewing-room
or den, or an extra bedroom, besides a neat little maid&rsquo;s
room in a notch on the half-way landing, and two bathrooms,
white-tiled and delightful, tucked away in between
things. Then Leslie opened a glass door in the
very prettiest room of all, which she and Allison immediately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
decided must belong to their aunt, and exclaimed
in delight; for here nestled between the gables,
with a tiled wall all about it, was a delightful housetop
or uncovered porch, so situated among the trees that
it was entirely shut in from the world.</p>
<p>It was perfect! They stood and looked at one
another in delight, and for the time the college was
forgotten. Then Allison dashed away, and came back
eagerly almost immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a garage!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just behind the
kitchen, a regular robin&rsquo;s nest of a one, white with
pink tiles just like the house, and a pebbled drive. Say,
it must be some fool of a guy that would sell this. Isn&rsquo;t
it just a crackerjack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; put in Julia Cloud, &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t help being
very expensive&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Cloudy, remember!&rdquo; said Leslie, holding
up her finger in mock rebuke. &ldquo;Just wait and see!
And, anyhow, you don&rsquo;t know Guardy Lud. If he
could see us located in a peach of a home like this,
he&rsquo;d go back to his growley old dear of a wife with
happy tears rolling down his nice old cheeks. Allison,
you go talk to that agent, and you give him a hundred
dollars if you&rsquo;ve got it left&ndash;&ndash;here, I guess I&rsquo;ve got some,
too&ndash;&ndash;just to bind the bargain till Guardy gets here.
And say, you go see if you can&rsquo;t get Guardy on the
&rsquo;phone. I don&rsquo;t want to go a step farther. Couldn&rsquo;t
you be happy here, Cloudy, with that fireplace, and
that prayer meeting to go to? I wouldn&rsquo;t mind going
with you sometimes when I didn&rsquo;t have to study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud stooped, and kissed the eager face, and
whispered, &ldquo;Very happy, darling!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>And then they went to the agent again and
the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guardy Lud&rdquo; proved himself quite equal to the
occasion by agreeing to come on at once and approve
their choice, and promised to be there before evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew he would,&rdquo; said Leslie happily, as they
seated themselves in the car again for the pleasant run
to the college.</p>
<p>They found the dean in his office, and Allison was
taken with him at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t much like that musty little guy in the
other college. He looked like a wet hen!&rdquo; growled
Allison in a low tone to his sister and aunt, while the
dean was out in the hall talking to a student. &ldquo;I like
him, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; and Julia Cloud sat wondering what
the boy&rsquo;s standards could be that he could judge
so suddenly and enthusiastically. Yet she had to admit
herself that she liked this man, tall and grave with
a pleasant twinkle hidden away in his wine-brown eyes
and around the corners of his firm mouth. She felt
satisfied that here was a man who would be both wise
and just.</p>
<p>They made the rounds of the college buildings
and campus with growing enthusiasm, and then drove
back to the inn to lunch with hearty appetites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down to the house, and measure things,
and look around once more,&rdquo; proposed Leslie. &ldquo;Then
we can come back and wait here for Guardy. We
mustn&rsquo;t be away when he arrives, for he&rsquo;ll want to get
everything fixed up and get away. I know him.
Allison, did you get a time-table?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison produced one from his coat-pocket, and
they studied the trains, and decided that there was no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
possibility of the arrival of their guardian until three
o&rsquo;clock, and probably not until five.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Leslie. &ldquo;Cloudy and I&rsquo;ll
stay here from three to five, and you can meet the
trains; but first I want the dimensions of those rooms,
so Cloudy and I can plan. We&rsquo;ve got a whole lot to
do before college opens, and we can&rsquo;t spare a minute.
O Cloudy! I&rsquo;m so happy! Isn&rsquo;t that house just
a duck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went to the village store, bought a foot-rule,
a yardstick, and a tape-measure, and repaired to the
house. Allison took the foot-rule by masculine right;
Julia Cloud said she felt more at home with the tape-measure;
and Leslie preferred the yardstick. With
pencil and paper they went to work, making a diagram
of each room, with spaces between windows and doors
for furniture, taking it room by room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to know about length of curtains, and
whether furniture will fit in,&rdquo; declared Leslie wisely.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought it all out nights in the sleeper on the
way over here. Just think! Isn&rsquo;t it going to be fun
furnishing the whole house? You know, Cloudy, I
didn&rsquo;t have hardly anything sent, because it really wasn&rsquo;t
worth while. We sort of wanted to leave the house at
home just as it was when Mamma was living, to come
back to sometimes; and so we let it to an old gentleman,
a friend of Grandfather&rsquo;s and Guardy&rsquo;s, who has
only himself and his wife and servants, and will take
beautiful care of it. But I went around and picked
out anything I wanted, rugs and pictures and some
bric-&agrave;-brac, and a few bits of old mahogany that I
love, just small things that would pack easily. Guardy
said we might buy our own things. He set a limit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
on our spending, of course; but he said it would be
good experience for us to learn how to buy wisely
inside a certain sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud went around like one in a dream with
her new tape-measure, setting down careful figures, and
feeling like a child playing dolls again. It was almost
three o&rsquo;clock when they finally finished their measurements,
and Allison hurried them back to the inn, and
repaired to the station to meet trains.</p>
<p>Leslie made her aunt lie down on the bed, supposedly
for a nap; but no one could have taken a nap
even if he had wanted to&ndash;&ndash;which Julia Cloud did not&ndash;&ndash;with
an eager, excited girl sitting beside the bed,
just fluttering with ideas about couches and pillows
and furniture and curtains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a great deep couch, with air-cushions
on the seat and back, and put it in the middle of the
living-room facing the fireplace, won&rsquo;t we, Cloudy?
And what color do you think would be pretty for the
cushions? I guess blue, deep, dark-blue brocaded velvet,
or something soft that will tone well with the
mahogany woodwork. I love mahogany in a white
room, don&rsquo;t you, Cloudy? And I had a great big
blue Chinese rug sent over that I think will do nicely
for there. You like blue, don&rsquo;t you, Cloudy?&rdquo; she
finished anxiously. &ldquo;Because I want to have you
like it more even than we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I love it!&rdquo; gasped Julia Cloud, trying to set
her mind to revel in extravagant desires without compunction.
She was not used to considering life in terms
of Chinese rugs or mahogany and brocade velvet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like the curtains next the windows to be all
alike all over the house, wouldn&rsquo;t you? Just sheer,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
soft, creamy white. And then inner curtains of Chinese
silk or something like that. We&rsquo;d want blue in the
living-room, of course, if we had the blue rugs and
couch, and oh! old rose, I guess, in the dining-room,
or perhaps mahogany color or tan. Green for that sun-porch
room! That&rsquo;s it, and lots of willow chairs and
tables! And rush mats on the tiled floor! Oh! Aren&rsquo;t
we having fun, Cloudy, dear? Now, I&rsquo;ll write out a
list of things we have to buy while you take a nap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it went on the whole afternoon, until the
sound of a distant whistle warned them that the five-o&rsquo;clock
train was coming in and they must be prepared
to meet Mr. Luddington.</p>
<p>According to programme they hurried into their
wraps, and went down to the piazza, to wait for the
car. None too soon, for Allison was already driving
around the curve in front of the door, and Mr.
Luddington sat beside him, radiating satisfaction.
Anything that pleased his adorable wards pleased him,
but this especially so, for he was in a hurry to respond
to the many telegrams summoning him home to California,
and the quicker this little household was settled,
the sooner he might leave them.</p>
<p>They drove at once, of course, to the house, Allison
and Leslie talking fast and eagerly every minute of the
way, their eyes bright and their faces beautiful with
enthusiasm; and Mr. Luddington could only sit and
listen, and smile over their heads at Julia Cloud, who
was smiling also, and who in her new silvery garments
looked to him all the more a lady and fit to play mother
to his wards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, now, now!&rdquo; said Guardy Lud after
they had gone carefully over every room and were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
coming down-stairs again. &ldquo;This is great! This certainly
is great. I couldn&rsquo;t have had it better if I&rsquo;d made
it to order, could I? And I certainly wish you were
settled here, and I could stay long enough to take breakfast
with you and enjoy some more of your excellent
buckwheat cakes, Miss Cloud.&rdquo; He turned with a gallant
bow to Julia. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll teach my little girl
here to bake them just like that, so she can make me
some when she comes back to California to visit
us again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rode him around the town, through the college
grounds, and then back to the inn for dinner.
That evening they spent in discussion and business
plans for the winter. The next morning they took
Mr. Luddington up to the college, where he made final
arrangements for the young people to be entered as
students, and afterwards drove to the city. Mr.
Luddington had one or two friends there to whom he
wished to introduce them, that they might have some
one near at hand to call upon in a time of need. He
also took them all to a bank, and arranged their bank
accounts so that they might draw what they needed at
any time. After lunch he went with them to several
of the largest stores, and opened a charge account for
them. Then, with a warm hand-shake for Julia Cloud
and an emotional good-by for the young people, he left
them to rush for his train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might stay in town to-night, and be ready to
shop early in the morning,&rdquo; proposed Leslie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Allison decidedly. &ldquo;Cloudy looks worn
to a frazzle, and I&rsquo;m sick to death of the city. Let&rsquo;s
beat it back to where they have good air. We can go
right to bed after dinner, and get up good and early,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
and be here as soon as the stores are open. They
don&rsquo;t open till nine o&rsquo;clock. I saw the signs on the
doors everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So back they went for a good night&rsquo;s rest, and were
up and at it early in the morning, scarcely noticing the
way they rode, so interested were they in deciding how
many chairs and beds and tables they needed to buy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get the curtains first, and then we can have
the windows washed, and put them right up,&rdquo; said
Leslie, &ldquo;and nobody can see in. I&rsquo;m crazy to be shut
into our own house, and feel that it belongs to us.
We can select them while Allison&rsquo;s gone to see what&rsquo;s
the matter with his engine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, when Julia Cloud heard the stupendous price
that was asked for ready-made curtains or curtains
made to order, with fixtures and installation, she exclaimed
in horror:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leslie! This is foolish. We can easily make
them ourselves, and put them up for less than half the
price. If I had only brought my sewing-machine! But
it was all out of repair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could we really make them ourselves, Cloudy?
Wouldn&rsquo;t that be fun? We&rsquo;ll get a sewing-machine,
of course. We&rsquo;ll need it for other things, too, sometimes,
won&rsquo;t we? Of course we&rsquo;ll get one. We&rsquo;ll buy
that next. Now, how many yards of each of these
do we need?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes the salesman had figured out
how much was needed, counted the number of fixtures
for doorways and windows, and arranged to send the
package down to the car at a certain time later in the
morning. Then they went at once and bought a sewing-machine,
one that Julia Cloud knew all about and said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
was the best and lightest on the market. Leslie was
as pleased with the idea of learning to run it as if it
had been a new toy and she a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have it sent right to the little new house,
and then we can go there evenings after we are through
shopping, and sew. You can cut, and I can put in the
hems, if you think I can do them well enough. We
must get scissors and thread, a lot of it, and silk to
match the colored curtains, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took the rooms one at a time, and furnished
them, Allison joining them, and taking as much interest
in the design of the furniture as if he had been a young
bridegroom just setting up housekeeping for himself.</p>
<p>They had set aside a certain sum for each room so
that they would not overstep their guardian&rsquo;s limit,
and with Julia Cloud to put on the brakes, and suggest
simplicity, and decide what was in good taste for such
a small village house, they easily came within the generous
limit allowed them.</p>
<p>It was a great game for Julia Cloud to come out
of her simple country life and plunge into this wholesale
beautiful buying untroubled by a continual feeling
that she must select the very cheapest without regard to
taste or desire. It was wonderful; but it was wearying
in spite of the delight, and so the little house was not
all furnished in a day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the living-room&rsquo;s done, anyway, and the
willow set for the porch room!&rdquo; sighed Leslie, leaning
back with a fling of weariness. &ldquo;Now to-morrow we&rsquo;ll
do the dining-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow&rsquo;s Sunday, Les; the stores aren&rsquo;t open.
Use your bean a little, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunday!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></div>
<p>Leslie&rsquo;s beautiful face drew itself into a snarl of
impatience, the first, really, that Julia Cloud had seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, darn!&rdquo; said Leslie&rsquo;s pretty lips. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that
too horrid? I forgot all about it. I wonder what they
have to have Sunday for, anyway. It&rsquo;s just a dull
old bore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Leslie, darling!&rdquo; said Julia Cloud, aghast,
something in her heart growing suddenly heavy and
sinking her down, down, so that she felt as if she
could hardly hold her head up another minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Cloudy, dear, don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s a bore
yourself, truly? Come, now, own up. And I&rsquo;m sure
I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s the use of it, do you? One can&rsquo;t do
a thing that&rsquo;s nice. But I&rsquo;ll tell you what we can
do!&rdquo; her eyes growing bright with eagerness again.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll measure and cut all the curtains, and turn the
hems up. And, Allison, you can put up the fixtures.
If only the machine could have been sent up to-day,
we could have had the curtains all done, couldn&rsquo;t
we, Cloudy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Julia Cloud&rsquo;s lips were white and trembling,
and her sweet eyes had suddenly gone dark with trouble
and apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Leslie, darling child!&rdquo; she gasped again.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean you would work on the Sabbath
day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, why not, Cloudy, dear? Is there anything
wrong about that?&rdquo;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XI' id='CHAPTER_XI'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>
<p>Julia Cloud had a sudden feeling that everything
was whirling beneath her&ndash;&ndash;the very foundations
of the earth. She drew a deep breath,
and tried to steady herself, thinking in her heart that
she must be very calm and not make any mistakes in
this great crisis that had arisen. It flashed across her
consciousness that she was a simple, old-fashioned
woman, accustomed to old-fashioned ideas, living all
her life in a little town where the line between the
church and the world was strongly marked, where the
traditions of Christianity were still held sacred in
the hearts of many and where the customs of
worldliness had not yet noticeably invaded. All
the articles she had read in the religious press about
the worldliness of the modern Sabbath, the terrible
desecration of the day that had been dear and sacred
to her all her life as being the time when she came
closest to her Lord; all the struggle between the church
and the world to keep the old laws rigidly; and all the
sneers she had seen in the secular press against the
fanatics who were trying to force the world back to
Puritanism, came shivering to her mind in one great
thrill of agony as she recognized that she was face to
face with one of the biggest religious problems of the
day, and must fight it out alone.</p>
<p>The beautiful life that had seemed to be opening
out before her was not, then, to be all beauty. Behind
the flowers of this new Eden there hid a serpent of
temptation; and she, Julia Cloud, disciple of the Lord
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
Christ, was to be tried out to see what faith there was
in her. For a moment she faltered, and closed her
eyes, shuddering. How could she face it, she, who
knew so little what to say and how to tell her quiet
heart-beliefs? Why had she been placed in such a
position? Why was there not some one wiser than
she to guide the feet of these children into the straight
and narrow way?</p>
<p>But only a moment she shrank thus. The voice
of her Master seemed to speak in her heart as the
wind whirled by the car and stirred the loose hair
on her forehead. The voice that had been her guide
through life was requiring her now to witness to these
two whom she loved, as no other could do it, be they
ever so wise; just because she loved them and loved
Him, and was not pretending to be wise, only following.
Then she drew a deep breath, reminded herself
once more that she must be careful not to antagonize,
and sat up gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, it is God&rsquo;s day, and I have always felt that
He wanted us to make it holy for Him, keep worldly
things out of it, you know. I wouldn&rsquo;t feel that I could
work on that day. Of course I have no right to say
you shall not. I&rsquo;m only your adviser and friend, you
know. But I&rsquo;d rather you wouldn&rsquo;t, because I know
God would rather you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie pouted uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the world could you know that?&rdquo; she
said almost crossly. She did love to carry out her
projects, and hitherto Julia Cloud had put no hindrance
in her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, He said so in His book. He said, &lsquo;Thou
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
daughter&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, those are the old commandments, Cloudy,
dear; and I&rsquo;ve heard people, even ministers, say that
they are out of date now. They don&rsquo;t have anything
to do with us nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud looked still graver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God doesn&rsquo;t change, Leslie. He is the same yesterday
and to-day and forever. And He said that
whoever took away from the meaning of the words
of His book would have some terrible punishment, so
that it were better that a millstone were hanged about
his neck and that he were drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think He&rsquo;d be a perfectly horrid God to
do that!&rdquo; said Leslie. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see how you can believe
any such old thing. It isn&rsquo;t like you, Cloudy, dear;
it&rsquo;s just some old thing you were taught. You don&rsquo;t
like to be long-faced and unhappy one day in the week,
you know you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long-faced! Unhappy! Why, dear child, God
doesn&rsquo;t want the Sabbath to be that. He wants it to
be the happiest day of all the week. I&rsquo;m never unhappy
on Sunday. I like it best of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Allison turned around, and looked at
Julia Cloud, saw the white, strained look around her
lips, the yearning light in her eyes, and had some swift
man&rsquo;s intuition about the true woman&rsquo;s soul of her.
For men, especially young men, do have these intuitions
sometimes as well as women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leslie,&rdquo; he said gently, as if he had suddenly
grown much older than his sister, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you see you&rsquo;re
hurting Cloudy? Cut it out! If Cloudy likes Sunday,
she shall have it the way she wants it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>Leslie turned with sudden compunction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Cloudy, dear, I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you; indeed
I didn&rsquo;t! I never thought you&rsquo;d care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, dear,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud with her
gentle voice, and just the least mite of a gasp. &ldquo;You
see&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;Sunday has been always very dear to me; I
hadn&rsquo;t realized you wouldn&rsquo;t feel the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed to shrink into herself; and, though the
smile still trembled on her lips, there was a hovering
of distress over her fine brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>will</i> feel the same!&rdquo; declared Allison. &ldquo;If
you feel that way so much, we&rsquo;ll manage somehow
to be loyal to what you think. You always do it for
us; and, if we can&rsquo;t be as big as you are, we haven&rsquo;t
got the gang spirit. It&rsquo;s teamwork, Leslie. Cloudy
goes to football games, and makes fudge for our
friends; and we go to church and help her keep Sunday
her way. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course! Sure!&rdquo; said Leslie, half bewildered.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean not to, of course, if Cloudy
likes such things; only she&rsquo;ll have to teach me how,
for I never did like those things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I say, let&rsquo;s get Cloudy to spend the first
Sunday telling us how she thinks Sunday ought to be
kept, and why. Is that a bargain, Cloudy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid I wouldn&rsquo;t be wise enough to
explain,&rdquo; faltered Julia Cloud, distress in her voice.
&ldquo;I could maybe find something to read to you about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, preserve us, Cloudy! We don&rsquo;t want any old
dissertations out of a book. If we can&rsquo;t have your own
thoughts that make you live it the way you do, we
haven&rsquo;t any use for any of it. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud forced a trembling little smile, and said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
she saw, and would do her best; but her heart sank at
the prospect. What a responsibility to be put upon her
ignorant shoulders. The Lord&rsquo;s Sabbath in her bungling
hands to make or to mar for these two young
souls! She must pray. Oh, she must pray continually
that she might be led!</p>
<p>And then there came swiftly to her mind one of
the verses that had become dear and familiar to her
through the years as she read and reread her Bible,
&ldquo;And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and
unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how
or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say; for
the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what
ye ought to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not exactly being brought before magistrates;
but it was being challenged for a reason for
the hope that was in her, and perhaps she could claim
the promise. Surely, if the Lord wanted her to defend
His Sabbath before these two, He would give her wise
words in which to speak. Anyhow, she would just
have to trust Him, for she had none of her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now see what you&rsquo;ve done, Leslie!&rdquo; said her
brother sharply. &ldquo;Cloudy hasn&rsquo;t looked that way once
before. Next thing you know she&rsquo;ll be washing her
hands of us and running off back to Sterling again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Cloudy!&rdquo; said the penitent Leslie, flinging
herself into her aunt&rsquo;s arms and nestling there beseechingly.
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t do that, would you, Cloudy,
dear? No matter how naughty I got? Because you
would know I wouldn&rsquo;t mean it ever. Even if I was
real bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud, kissing her fair
forehead. &ldquo;But this is just one of those things that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
I meant when I was afraid to undertake it. You see
there may be a great many things you will want to do
on Sunday that I would not feel it right for me to do,
and I may be a hindrance to you in lots of ways. I
shouldn&rsquo;t like to get to be a sort of burden to you,
and it isn&rsquo;t as if they were things that I could give
up, you know. This is a matter of conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Cloudy,&rdquo; put in Allison. &ldquo;You
have your say in things like that. We aren&rsquo;t so selfish
as all that. And besides, if it&rsquo;s wrong for you, who
knows but it&rsquo;s wrong for us, too? We&rsquo;ll look into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud went smiling through the rest of the
evening, but underneath was a tugging of strange dread
and fear at her heart. It was all so new, this having
responsibility with souls. She had always so quietly
trusted her Bible and tried to follow her Lord. She
had never had to guide others. There had not been time
for her even to take a class in Sunday school, and she
knew her religion only as it applied to her one little
narrow life, she thought, not realizing that, when one
has applied a great faith to the circumstances of even
a narrow life, and applied it thoroughly through a lifetime,
one has learned more theology than one could
get in years of a theological seminary. Theories, after
all, are worth little unless they have been worked out in
experience; and when one has patiently, even happily,
given up much of the joy of living to serve, has learned
to keep self under and love even the unlovable, has put
to the test the promises of the Bible and found them
hold true in time of need, and has found the Sabbath
day an oasis in the desert of an otherwise dreary life,
even an old theologian wouldn&rsquo;t have much more to go
on in beginning a discussion on Sabbath-keeping.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></div>
<p>Quite early the next morning, before Leslie had
awakened, Julia Cloud had slipped softly to her knees
by the bedside, and was communing with her heavenly
Father concerning her need of guidance.</p>
<p>When Leslie awoke, her aunt was sitting by the
window with her Bible on her knee and a sweet look
of peace on her face, the morning sunlight resting on
the silvery whiteness of her hair like a benediction. It
was perhaps the soft turning of a leaf that brought
the girl to wakefulness, and she lay for some time
quietly watching her aunt and thinking the deep
thoughts of youth. Perhaps nothing could have so
well prepared her for the afternoon talk as that few
minutes of watching Julia Cloud&rsquo;s face as she read her
Bible, glancing now and then from the window thoughtfully,
as if considering something she had read. Julia
Cloud was reading over everything that her Bible said
about the Sabbath, and with the help of her concordance
she was being led through a very logical train of
thought, although she did not know it. If you had
asked her, she would have said that she had not been
thinking about what she would say to the children;
she had been deep in the meaning that God sent to her
own soul.</p>
<p>But when Leslie finally stirred and greeted her,
Julia Cloud looked up with a smile of peace; and there
was no longer a little line of worry between her
straight brows.</p>
<p>The peace lasted all through the morning, and went
with her down to breakfast; and something of her enjoyment
of the day seemed to pervade the atmosphere
about her and extend to the two young people. They
hovered about her, anxious to please, and a trifle ill at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
ease at first lest they should make some mistake about
this day that seemed so holy to their aunt and had
always been to them nothing but a bore to get through
with in the jolliest way possible.</p>
<p>There was no question about going to church. They
just went. Leslie and Allison had never made a practice
of doing so since they had been left to themselves.
It had not been necessary in the circle in which they
moved. When they went to school, and had to go to
church, they evaded the rule as often as possible. But
somehow they felt without being told that if they tried
to remain away now it would hurt their aunt more
than anything else they could do; and, while they were
usually outspoken and frank, they both felt that here
was a time to be silent about their habits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to church,&rdquo; said Allison in a low
tone as he drew his sister&rsquo;s chair away from the breakfast-table.
His tone had the quality of command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; responded Leslie quietly.</p>
<p>It was so that Julia Cloud was spared the knowledge
that her two dear young people did not consider it
necessary to attend church every Sabbath, and her peace
was not disturbed.</p>
<p>The sermon in the little stucco church where they
had gone to prayer meeting that first night was not
exceedingly enlivening nor uplifting. The minister was
prosy with dignity, soaring into occasional flights of
eloquence that reminded one of a generation ago. There
was nothing about it to bring to mind the sweetness of
a Sabbath communion with Christ, nothing to remind a
young soul that Christ was ready to be Friend and
Saviour. It was rather a dissertation on one of the
epistles with a smack of modern higher criticism. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
young people watched the preacher a while listlessly,
and wished for the end; but a glance at the quiet,
worshipful face of their aunt kept them thoughtful.
Julia Cloud evidently had something that most
other people did not have, they said to themselves, some
inner light that shone through her face, some finer sight
and keener ear that made her see and hear what was
not given to common mortals to comprehend; and because
she sat thus with the light of communion on her
face they, too, sat with respectful hearts and tried
to join lustily in the hymns with their fresh voices.</p>
<p>The minister came down and shook hands with
them, welcoming them kindly. He seemed more human
out of the pulpit, and asked quite interestedly where
they were to live and whether he might call. He mentioned
Sunday school and Christian Endeavor, and
said he hoped they would &ldquo;cast in their lot&rdquo; among
them; and the young people gave him cold little smiles
and withdrew into themselves while their aunt did the
talking. They were willing she should have her Sabbath,
and they would do all in their power to make
it what she wanted; but they were hostile toward this
church and this minister and all that it had to do with.
It simply did not interest them. Julia Cloud saw this
in their eyes as she turned to go away, and sighed
softly to herself. How much there was to teach them!
Could she ever hope to make them feel differently?
In two short weeks the college would open, and they
would be swept away on a whirl of work and play
and new friends and functions. Was she strong
enough to stem the tide of worldliness that would ingulf
them? No, not of herself. But she had read that
very morning the promises of her Lord, &ldquo;Surely I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
will be with thee,&rdquo; &ldquo;I will help thee&rdquo;; and she meant
to lay hold on them closely. She could do nothing of
herself, but she with her Lord helping could do anything
He wanted done. That was enough.</p>
<p>Leslie turned longing eyes toward the winding
creek and an alluring canoe that lolled idly at the
bank down below the inn as she stood on the piazza
after dinner waiting for her aunt; but Allison saw
her glance, and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not suggest it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are a lot
of picnickers down there carrying on high. She would
not like it, I&rsquo;m sure. If it were all quiet and no one
about, it would be different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there are a lot of people around here on
the piazzas,&rdquo; said Leslie disconsolately. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see
the difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, when Julia Cloud came with her Bible slipped
unobtrusively under her arm, she suggested a quiet
spot in the woods; and so they wandered off through
the trees with a big blanket from the car to sit on, and
found a wonderful place, high above the water, where
a great rift of rocks jutted out among drooping hemlocks,
and was carpeted with pine-needles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would please me very much,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud
as she sat down on the blanket and opened her Bible,
looking up wistfully at the two, &ldquo;if you two would
go to that Christian Endeavor meeting to-night. I
hate to ask you to do anything like that right away, but
that minister begged me to get you to come. He said
they were having such a struggle to make it live and
that they needed some fresh young workers. He asked
me if you didn&rsquo;t sing, and he said singers were very
much needed.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>There was a heavy silence for a moment while the
two young things looked at each other aghast across
her, and Julia Cloud kept her eyes on the floating clouds
above the hemlocks. She still had that softened look
of being within a safe shelter where storms and
troubles could not really trouble her; yet there was a
dear, eager look in her eyes. Both children saw it, and
with wonderful intuition interpreted it; and because
their hearts were young and tender they yielded to
its influence.</p>
<p>Leslie swooped down upon her aunt with an overwhelming
kiss, and Allison dropped down beside her
with a &ldquo;Sure, we&rsquo;ll go, Cloudy, if that will do you
any good. I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m keen about pleasing that stiff
old parson guy, but anything <i>you</i> want is different.
I don&rsquo;t know just what you&rsquo;re letting us in for, but I
guess we can stand most anything once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud put out a hand to grasp a hand of
each; and, looking up, they saw that there were tears
in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are those happy tears, Cloudy, or the other kind?
Tell us quick, or we&rsquo;ll jump in the creek and drown
ourselves,&rdquo; laughed Leslie; and then two white handkerchiefs,
one big and one little, came swiftly out and
dabbed at her cheeks until there wasn&rsquo;t a sign of a tear
to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m almost too happy to talk,&rdquo; said Julia
Cloud, resting back against the tree and looking up into
its lacy green branches. &ldquo;It seems as if I was just
beginning my life over and being a child again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few minutes they sat so, looking up into the
changing autumn sky, listening to the soft tinkle of the
water running below, the dip of an oar, the swirl of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
blue heron&rsquo;s wing as it clove the air, the distant voices
of the picnickers farther down the creek, the rustle
of the yellow beech-leaves as they whispered of the time
to go, and how they would drift down like little brown
boats to the stream and glide away to the end. Now
and then a nut would fall with a tiny crisp thud, and
a squirrel would whisk from a limb overhead. They
were very quiet, and let the beauty of the spot sink
deep into their souls. Then at last Julia Cloud took
up her Bible, and began to talk.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
<a name='CHAPTER_XII' id='CHAPTER_XII'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>
<p>There were tiny slips of paper in Julia Cloud&rsquo;s
well-worn Bible, and she turned to the first one
shyly. It was such new work to her to be talking
about these things to any but her own worshipful
soul.</p>
<p>The two young people settled back in comfortable
attitudes on the blanket, and put their gaze upon the
far sky overhead. They were embarrassed also, but
they meant to carry this thing through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus the heavens and the earth were finished,
and all the host of them,&rdquo; read Julia Cloud; and
straightway the shining blue above them took on a personality,
and became a witness in the day&rsquo;s proceedings.
It was as if some one whom they had known all their
lives, quite familiar in their daily life, should suddenly
have stood up and declared himself to have been an
eye-witness to most marvellous proceedings. The hazy
blue with its floating clouds was no longer a diversion
from the subject in hand. Their eyes were riveted with
mysterious thoughts as they lay and listened, astonished,
fascinated. It was the first time it had ever
really entered into their consciousness that there
had been a time when there was no blue, no firm
earth, no anything. Whether it were true or not
had not as yet become a question with them. They
were near enough to their fairy-story days to accept a
tale while it was being read, and revel in it.</p>
<p>The quiet voice went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And on the seventh day God ended his work
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day
from all his work which he had made. And God blessed
the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it
he had rested from all his work which God created
and made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did He have to rest for? A God wouldn&rsquo;t
get tired, would He?&rdquo; burst forth Leslie, turning big
inquiring eyes on Julia Cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, unless He did it for our sakes to
set us an example,&rdquo; she answered slowly, &ldquo;although
that might mean He rested in the sense of stopped doing
it, you know. And that would imply that He had some
reason for doing so. I&rsquo;m not very wise, you know,
and because I may not be able to answer your questions
doesn&rsquo;t mean they can&rsquo;t be answered by some one who
has studied it all out. I&rsquo;ve often wished I could have
gone to college and studied Greek and Hebrew, so I
could have read the Bible in the original.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said Allison thoughtfully. &ldquo;That would
be interesting, wouldn&rsquo;t it? I always wondered why
they did it, but I don&rsquo;t know but I&rsquo;ll study them myself.
I think I&rsquo;d enjoy it if there was a real reason besides
just the discipline of it they are always talking about
when you kick about mathematics and languages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Leslie, sitting up interestedly, &ldquo;is
that all there is to it? Did some one just up and say
we had to keep Sunday because God did? I think
that is a kind of superstition. I don&rsquo;t see that God
would want to make us do everything He did. We
couldn&rsquo;t. I <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> unless <i>He</i> said to, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Les! You&rsquo;re way off,&rdquo; laughed her brother.
&ldquo;God did. He said, &lsquo;Remember the sabbath day to
keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
thy work, but the seventh day is the sabbath of the
Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou,
nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man servant nor
thy maid servant&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t you remember the Ten
Commandments? No, I guess you were too little to
learn them. But I got a Testament for learning them
once. Say, Cloudy, when did He give that command?
Right away after He made Adam and Eve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud, fluttering the
leaves of her Bible over to the second slip of paper. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t find any reference to it in my concordance till
way over here in Exodus, after the children of Israel
had been in Egypt so many years, and Moses led them
out through the wilderness, and they got fretful because
they hadn&rsquo;t any bread such as they used to have in
Egypt, so God sent them manna that fell every morning.
But He told them not to leave any over for the
next day because it would gather worms and smell bad,
except on Saturday, when they were to gather enough
for the Sabbath. Listen: &lsquo;And they gathered it every
morning, every man according to his eating; and when
the sun waxed hot, it melted. And it came to pass,
that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread,
two omers for one man; and all the rulers of the congregation
came and told Moses. And he said unto
them, This is that which the Lord hath said, To-morrow
is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the Lord;
bake that, which ye will bake to-day, and seethe that ye
will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for
you to be kept until the morning. And they laid it up
till the morning, as Moses bade; and it did not stink,
neither was there any worm therein. And Moses said,
Eat that to-day; for to-day is a sabbath unto the Lord:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
to-day ye shall not find it in the field. Six days ye shall
gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath,
in it there shall be none. And it came to pass,
that there went out some of the people on the seventh
day for to gather, and they found none. And the
Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my
commandments and my laws? See, for that the Lord
hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you
on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every
man in his place, let no man go out of his place on
the seventh day. So the people rested on the seventh
day.&rsquo; It looks as though the people had been used to
the Sabbath already, for the commandments given on
the mount come three whole chapters later. It looks
to me as if God established the Sabbath right at the
beginning when He rested from His own work, and
that&rsquo;s what it means when it says He sanctified it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose He said, &lsquo;I have given <i>you</i>
a sabbath&rsquo; for? It looks as if it were meant for a
benefit for the people and not for God, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
said Allison, sitting up and looking over his aunt&rsquo;s
shoulder. &ldquo;Why, I always supposed God wanted the
Sabbath for His own sake, so people would see how
great He was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud&rsquo;s cheeks grew red with a flash of distress
as if he had said something against some one she loved
very much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; she said earnestly. &ldquo;God isn&rsquo;t like
that. Why, He loves us! He wouldn&rsquo;t have given a
Sabbath at all if it hadn&rsquo;t been quite necessary for
our good. Besides, in the New Testament, Jesus
said, &lsquo;The sabbath was made for man, and not man
for the sabbath&rsquo;! Oh, He made it for us, to be happy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
in, I&rsquo;m sure. And perhaps He rested Himself so that
we might understand He had set apart that time of leisure
in order to be everything to us on the day when
we had most time for Him. I have read somewhere
that God had to teach those early people little by little
just as we teach babies, a few things each year; and
over in the New Testament it says that all these things
that happened in the Old Testament to those children of
Israel happened and were written down for an example
to us who should live in the later part of the world.
So, little by little, by pictures and stories He taught
those people what He wanted all of us to know as a
sort of inheritance. And He took the things first that
were of the most importance. It would seem as if
He considered this matter of the Sabbath very important,
and as if He had it in mind right away at the
first when He made the world, and intended to set apart
this day out of every seven, because He stopped right
off the very first week Himself to establish a precedent,
and then He &lsquo;sanctified&rsquo; it, which must mean
He set it apart in such a way that all the world
should understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is a precedent?&rdquo; asked Leslie sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know, Les, it&rsquo;s something you have to
do just like because you always have done it that
way,&rdquo; said Allison, waving her aside. &ldquo;But, Cloudy,
what I can&rsquo;t get at at all is why He wanted it in the
first place if He didn&rsquo;t want it just entirely for His
own glorification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, dear, I am not sure; but I think it was just
so that He and we might have a sort of a trysting-time
when we could be sure of having nothing to interfere
between us. And He meant it, too, to be the sign
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
between Himself and those who really loved Him and
were His children, a sign that should show to the
world who were His. He said so in several places.
Listen to this.&rdquo; She turned the leaves quickly. &ldquo;&lsquo;And
the Lord spake unto Moses, saying: Speak thou also
unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths
ye shall keep; for it is a sign between me and you
throughout your generations; that ye may know that
I am the Lord that doth sanctify you. Ye shall keep
the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you; every one
that defileth it shall surely be put to death; for whosoever
doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off
from among his people. Six days may work be done;
but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the
Lord; whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day,
he shall surely be put to death. Wherefore the children
of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath
throughout their generations, for a perpetual
covenant. It is a sign between me and the children
of Israel forever; for in six days the Lord made heaven
and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and
was refreshed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! Now!&rdquo; said Leslie, sitting up. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
just what I thought! That was only for the children
of Israel. It hasn&rsquo;t the leastest bit to do with us.
Those were Jews, and they keep it yet, on Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, dear!&rdquo; Julia Cloud turned the leaves of
her Bible rapidly to Corinthians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! &lsquo;Moreover, brethren, I would not that
ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were
under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and
were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the
sea; and did all eat the same spiritual meat; and did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
all drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of
that spiritual Rock that followed them; and that Rock
was Christ. But with many of them God was not well
pleased; for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
Now these things were our examples, to the intent we
should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
Neither, be ye idolators, as were some of them; as it is
written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and
rose up to play.... Neither let us tempt Christ,
as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed
of serpents. Neither murmur ye, as some of them also
murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer. Now
all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and
they are written for our admonition, upon whom the
ends of the world are come. Wherefore let him that
thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.&rsquo; Doesn&rsquo;t
that look as though God meant the Sabbath for us,
too, Leslie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie dropped back on her pillow of moss with a
sigh. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose it does,&rdquo; she answered somewhat disconsolately.
&ldquo;But I never did like Sundays anyhow!&rdquo;
and she drew a deep breath of unrest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dear,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Julia Cloud&rsquo;s hand rested on the
bright head lovingly,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a closer sense than that
in which this belongs to us if we belong to Christ; we
are Israel ourselves. I was reading about it just this
morning, how all those who want to be Christ&rsquo;s chosen
people, and are willing to accept Him as their Saviour,
are Israel just as much as a born Jew. I think I can
find it again. Yes, here it is in Romans: &lsquo;For they are
not all Israel which are <i>of</i> Israel: neither, because they
are the seed of Abraham, are they all children; but, In
Isaac shall thy seed be called. That is, they which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
are children of the flesh, these are not the children of
God: but the children of the promise are counted for
the seed.&rsquo; That means the promise that was given to
Abraham that there should be a Messiah sometime in
his family who would be the Saviour of the world, and
the idea is that all who believe in that Messiah are the
real chosen people. It was to the chosen people God
gave these careful directions&ndash;&ndash;commands, if you like
to call them&ndash;&ndash;to help them be what a chosen people
ought to be. And the Sabbath rest and communion
seems to be the basis of the whole idea of a people
who were guided by God. It is the coming home to
God after the toil of the week. They had to have a
time when other things did not call them away from
spending a whole day with Him and getting acquainted,
from getting to know what He wanted and how to
shape their lives, or they would just as surely get interested
in the world and forget God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see why we have to go to church,
anyway,&rdquo; declared Leslie discontentedly. &ldquo;This is a
great deal better out here under the trees, reading
the Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Allison. &ldquo;Cloudy, that minister&rsquo;s dull.
I know I wouldn&rsquo;t get anything out of hearing him
chew the rag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Allison, dear! Don&rsquo;t speak of God&rsquo;s minister
that way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, Cloudy? Maybe he isn&rsquo;t God&rsquo;s minister.
How did he get there, anyway? Just decided to be a
minister, and studied, and got himself called to that
church, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, dear! I trust not. That is terrible!
Where ever did you get such an idea? There may be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
some unworthy men in the ministry. Of course there
must be, for the Bible said there would be false leaders
and wolves in sheep&rsquo;s clothing; but surely, <i>surely</i> you
know that the most of the men in the pulpit are there
because they believe that God has called them to give
up everything else and spend their lives bringing the
message of the gospel to the souls of men. The office
is a holy office, and must be reverenced even if we do
not fancy the man who occupies it. He may have
a message if you listen for it, even though he may seem
dull to you. If you knew him better, could look into
his life and see the sacrifices he has made to be a
minister, see the burdens of the people he has to bear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Cloudy, come now. Most of the ministers
I ever saw have automobiles and fine houses, and about
as good a time as anybody. They get big salaries, and
don&rsquo;t bother themselves much about anything but
church services and getting people to give money.
Honestly, now, Cloudy Jewel, I think they&rsquo;re putting
it over on you. I&rsquo;ll bet not half of them are sincere
in that sacrifice stuff they put over. It may have been
so long ago; but ministers have a pretty soft snap nowadays,
in cities anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allison! Didn&rsquo;t you ever see any true, sincere
ministers, child? There are so many, many of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth, Cloudy, I never saw but
one that didn&rsquo;t have shifty eyes. He was a little missionary
chap that worked in a slum settlement and
would have taken his eye-teeth out for anybody. Oh,
I don&rsquo;t mean that old guy to-day looked shifty. I
should say he was just dull and uninteresting. He may
have thought he had a call long ago, but he&rsquo;s been
asleep so long he&rsquo;s forgotten about it.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
&ldquo;O Allison! This is dreadful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud closed her Bible, and looked down in
horror at the frank young face of the boy who minced
no words in saying what he thought about these holy
things that had always been so precious and sacred
to her. She felt like putting her hands over her ears
and running away screaming. Her very soul was in
agony over the desecration. The children looked into
her face, saw the white, scared look, and took warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now, Cloudy, don&rsquo;t worry!&rdquo; said Allison,
leaning over and patting her hand awkwardly. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you; honest I didn&rsquo;t. Perhaps
I&rsquo;m wrong. Of course I am if you say so. I don&rsquo;t
really know any ministers, anyhow. I was just
saying what is the general impression among the fellows.
I didn&rsquo;t realize you would <i>care</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the young men all think that?&rdquo; Julia Cloud&rsquo;s
lips were white, and an agonized expression for the
church of God had grown in her eyes. She searched
the boy&rsquo;s face with a look he did not soon forget. It
made an impression that stayed with him always. At
least, there was something in religion if it could make
her look like that to hear it lightly spoken of. At least
this one woman was a sincere follower of Christ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now, Cloudy! I tell you I&rsquo;m sorry I said
that; and just to prove it I&rsquo;ll go to that old Christian
Endeavor to-night, and try to find something interesting.
I will truly. And Les will go, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; said Leslie, nestling close. &ldquo;Forget
what he said, and tell us why we have to go to church,
Cloudy, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud tried to recall her troubled thoughts
to the subject in hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, God had them build the tabernacle for worship,
you know, dear; told them how to make everything
even to the minutest details, and established worship.
That was to be part of the Sabbath day, a place
to worship, and a promise that He would be there
to meet any one who came. That promise holds good
to-day. You needn&rsquo;t ever think about the minister.
Just fancy you see Christ in the pulpit. He is there,
come to meet His own, you know. He&rsquo;ll be in that
Christian Endeavor to-night. He was in the tabernacle
of old. There was a brightness in the cloud of
His presence to show the people that God had come
down to meet them. They were children, and had
to be helped by a visible manifestation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that would be something like!&rdquo; said Allison.
&ldquo;If we could see something to help us believe&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who truly believe with the heart will have
the assurance,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud earnestly. &ldquo;I <i>know</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something in her tone and the look of
her eye that added, &ldquo;For I have experienced it.&rdquo; The
young people looked at her, and were silent. There
was a long, quiet pause in which the sounds of the falling
nuts and the whispering of the hemlocks closed in
about them, and made the day and hour a sacred time.
At last Leslie broke the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Cloudy, suppose we go to church and Christian
Endeavor. What can we do the rest of the day?
We don&rsquo;t have to go to church every minute, do we?
I don&rsquo;t really see how it&rsquo;s going to do me any good.
I don&rsquo;t, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud smiled at her wistfully. It was so
wonderfully sweet to have this bright, beautiful young
thing asking her these vital questions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, deary, it&rsquo;s just a day to spend with God
and get to enjoy His company,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let me
read you this verse in Isaiah: &lsquo;Blessed&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;that means,
&lsquo;O the happiness of&rsquo;: I&rsquo;ll read it so&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;O the happiness
of the man that doeth this, and the son of man that
layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting
it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.
Neither let the son of the stranger that hath joined
himself to the Lord&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;there, Leslie, that means us, or
any Gentiles that want to be Christ&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;speak, saying,
The Lord hath utterly separated us from his people....
For thus saith the Lord to&rsquo; them &lsquo;that keep
my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me,
and take hold of my covenant; even unto them will I
give in mine house and within my walls a place and a
name better than of sons and of daughters; I will give
them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.
Also the sons of the stranger that join themselves to
the Lord, to serve him, and to love the name of the
Lord, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the
sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;
even them will I bring to my holy mountain,
and make them joyful in my house of prayer&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;you see,
Allison, there&rsquo;s a promise that will secure you from
feeling the service dull and dry if you are willing to
comply with its conditions&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;their burnt offerings and
their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for
mine house shall be called an house of prayer for
all people.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned the leaves quickly again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I want to read you the verse that seems
to me to tell how God likes us to keep the Sabbath. &lsquo;If
thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath
a delight&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;you see, Leslie, He doesn&rsquo;t want it to be
a dull, poky day. He wants us to call it a delight. And
yet we are to find our pleasure in Him, and not in
the things that belong just to ourselves. Listen: &lsquo;a
delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt
honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine
own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt
thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee
to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee
with the heritage of Jacob thy father; for the mouth of
the Lord hath spoken it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie suddenly threw her head in Julia Cloud&rsquo;s lap
right over the Bible, and looked up into her face with
an exquisite earnestness all her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloudy Jewel, it sounds all different from anything
I ever heard of, and I don&rsquo;t know how to do it;
but something inside says it ought to be true, and I&rsquo;m
going to try it!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Anyhow, we&rsquo;ve had a
grand time this afternoon, and it hasn&rsquo;t been a bit
dull. Do you suppose maybe we&rsquo;ve been &lsquo;delighting&rsquo;
in Him this afternoon? But there goes the supper
bell, and I&rsquo;m hungry as a bear. How about that,
Cloudy? Is it right to cook on Sunday? That place
you read about the man who picked up sticks to make
a fire in camp doesn&rsquo;t sound like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dear, you know in the old times we always
got the Sunday cooking and baking done on Saturday,
just as the Lord told the Israelites to do. I haven&rsquo;t
any business to judge other people, and every one must
decide for himself what is necessary and what is not,
I suppose; but, as for me, I like to do as mother always
did. I always have the cake-box and bread-box full of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
nice fresh things, and make a pie, perhaps, and cook a
piece of meat, or have some salad in the ice-box; and
then it is the work of but a few minutes to get the
nicest kind of a meal on Sunday. It is easy to have
a beefsteak to broil, or cold meat, or something to
warm up in a minute if one cares enough to get it
ready; and it really makes a lovely, restful time on
Sunday to know all that work is done. Besides, it isn&rsquo;t
any harder. I like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison gathered up the rug and books, and they
walked slowly toward the inn, watching the wonderful
colorings of the foliage they passed, and drinking in all
the woodsy odors and gentle sounds of dying leaves
and dropping nuts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Cloudy,&rdquo; said Allison suddenly out of the
midst of his thoughtfulness, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t the ministers
preach about all this? I had to go to church a lot when
I was in prep school, and I never yet heard a sermon
on it. Or, if I did, it was so dull I didn&rsquo;t get the hang
of it. But I should think if they preached about it just
as you&rsquo;ve done, made it plain so people could understand,
that most folks, that is, the ones who wanted
to do half right, would see to it that Sunday wasn&rsquo;t
so rotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Allison,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud, a soft smile playing
dreamfully about her lips, &ldquo;perhaps they don&rsquo;t
realize the need. Perhaps it&rsquo;s &lsquo;up to you,&rsquo; as you say,
to somehow wake them up and set them at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison drew a long whistle and grinned as they
went into the house.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>
<p>A few minutes later Julia Cloud watched them
go off into the dusk to the Christian Endeavor
meeting. She was to follow them in a little
while and meet them for the evening service. She
wondered as she saw them disappear into the shadows
of the long maple-lined avenue whether perhaps she was
not overdoing the matter a little in the way of meetings,
and was almost sorry she had not suggested staying
home from the evening service. It would not do to
make them weary of it all on this first Sunday.</p>
<p>As they walked along together, the brother and sister
were thinking deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Allison, isn&rsquo;t this the very funniest thing
we ever did, going off like this to a prayer meeting
alone? What did we do it for?&rdquo; asked the sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess just because Cloudy wanted it,&rdquo;
replied the brother. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s given up her home and
everything for us; we ought to. But say, Les, there&rsquo;s
a whole lot in what Cloudy was reading this afternoon.
If it&rsquo;s all true, it&rsquo;s a wonder more people don&rsquo;t try it.
I&rsquo;ve often wondered why we were alive, anyway,
haven&rsquo;t you? There doesn&rsquo;t seem much sense to it
unless there&rsquo;s something like this.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, Allison; it&rsquo;s nice to be alive.
But of course we never will feel quite as if this is the
only place since Mother and Dad aren&rsquo;t here any more.
Aren&rsquo;t things queer, anyway? I wish there was some
way to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I s&rsquo;pose the Bible claims to be sure. Perhaps
we could find out a lot if we read it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re likely to read it quite a good deal, don&rsquo;t
you think?&rdquo; asked the sister archly. &ldquo;But really, now,
it was interesting, and isn&rsquo;t Cloudy a dear? If Christians
were all like that, I&rsquo;d believe in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they are, real Christians. Perhaps the
ones we mean aren&rsquo;t anything but shams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a good many shams, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big, noisy bell began to bang out a tardy
summons now; but the two young people did not feel
the same antipathy toward it that they had felt the night
they heard it first. It seemed somehow to have a
homely, friendly sound. As they neared the open door,
they grew suddenly shy, however, and drew back, lingering
on the corner, watching the few stragglers who
walked into the pathway of light that streamed from
the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some bunch!&rdquo; growled Allison. &ldquo;I should say
they did need waking up, but I don&rsquo;t hanker for
the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They slipped in, and followed the sound of voices,
through a dimly-lighted hall, smelling of moldy ingrain
carpet, into a wide, rather pleasant, chapel room. There
were branches of autumn leaves about the walls, reminiscent
of some recent festivity, and a bunch of golden-rod
in a vase on the little table by the leader&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>Two girls were turning over the hymn-book, picking
out hymns for the evening; and a tall, shy, girlish young
fellow was making fancy letters on a blackboard up in
front. Three more girls with their arms about one another
had surrounded him, and were giggling and
gurgling at him after the manner of that kind of girl.
Another plain-faced, plainly-dressed young woman sat
half-way up at one side, her hands folded and a look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
of quiet waiting on her face. That was all that were
in the room.</p>
<p>Allison and Leslie found a seat half-way up on the
other side from the plain-faced girl, and sat down.
No one noticed them save for furtive glances, and no
one came near them. The three giggling girls began
to talk a little louder. One with her hair bobbed and
a long view of vertebrae above her blue dress-collar
began to prattle of a dance the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d die!&rdquo; she chortled. &ldquo;Bob had me
by the arm; and here was my dress caught on Archie&rsquo;s
button, and he not knowing and whirling off in the
other direction; and the georgette just ripped and tore
to beat the band, and me trying to catch up with Archie,
and Bob hanging on to me, honest.&ndash;&ndash;You&rsquo;d uv croaked
if you could uv seen me. Oh, but Mother was mad
when she saw my dress! She kept blaming me, for
she knew I hated that dress and wanted a new one.
But me, <i>I&rsquo;m</i> glad. Now I&rsquo;ll get after Dad for a new
one. Say, when&rsquo;s Mary&rsquo;s surprise? Is it true it&rsquo;s put
off till next week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a new dress for that and silver
slippers,&rdquo; declared the girl next her, teetering back and
forth on her little high-heeled pumps. &ldquo;Say, Will,
that letter&rsquo;s cock-eyed. What are you giving us?
What&rsquo;s the old topic, anyway? I don&rsquo;t see any use in
topics. They don&rsquo;t mean anything. I never can find a
verse with the words in. I just always ask for a hymn,
and half the time I give out any old number without
knowing what it is, just to see what it&rsquo;ll turn out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, say! Did you hear Chauncey Cramer singing
last Sunday night?&rdquo; broke out the third girl with
a side glance at the strangers. &ldquo;He was perfectly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
killing. He was twisting the words all around in every
hymn. He had girls&rsquo; names and fellers&rsquo; all mixed up,
and made it rhyme in the neatest way. I thought I&rsquo;d
choke laughing, and Dr. Tarrant was just coming in,
and looked at me as if he&rsquo;d eat me. Oh, my goodness!
There he comes now. We better beat it, Hattie.
Come on, Mabel. Let&rsquo;s sit back in the last row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three girls toppled down the aisle on their
high-heeled pumps, and rustled into the back row just
as the pastor entered and looked about the room. His
eyes brightened when he saw the brother and sister,
and with a pleasant &ldquo;Good-evening&rdquo; to the three
whispering misses in the back seat he came over to
shake hands with Allison and Leslie. But, when he
expressed a most cordial hope that the two would come
in and help in the young people&rsquo;s work, Allison was
wary. He said they would have to see how much time
they had to spare after college opened. It was altogether
likely that they would be exceedingly busy with
their college work.</p>
<p>The minister, watching their bright faces wistfully,
and knowing their kind, sighed, and thought how
little likelihood there was that his Christian Endeavor
society would see much of them.</p>
<p>A few more people straggled in, and one of the
girls who had been picking out hymns went and sat
down at the piano. The other girl sat near her. The
young man at the blackboard took his place at the little
table in front of the desk, and the elaborate colored
letters which he had just made were visible as a whole
for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Great Companion: How to Live with Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something startling and solemn in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
words as they stood out in blue and gold and crimson
and white on the little blackboard. Allison and Leslie
looked and turned wonderingly toward the young
leader. He had corn-colored hair, light, ineffective
blue eyes, and a noticeably weak chin. He did not
look like a person who would be putting forth a topic
of that sort and attempting to do anything about it.
His face grew pink, and his eyelashes seemed whiter in
contrast as he stood up to give out the first hymn.
It was plain that he was painfully embarrassed. He
glanced now and then deprecatingly toward the visitors
with an anxious gasp as he announced that they would
open the meeting by singing number twenty-nine. The
two young strangers opened their hymn-books and
found the place, marvelling how such a youth had
ever been persuaded to get himself into such a trying
situation. Allison found himself thinking that there
must be some power greater than the ordinary influences
of life that made him do it. He seemed so much out
of his element, and so painfully shy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All to Jesus I surrender!&rdquo; chirped the little gathering
gayly. They had good voices, and the harmony
was simple and pleasing. Allison and Leslie joined
their beautiful voices in with the rest, and liked it,
felt almost as if they were on the verge of doing
something toward helping on the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>They sang another hymn, and more young people
came in until there were twenty-four in the room.
Then the leader called upon Tom Forbes to read the
Scripture, and a boy about fourteen years old read in
a clear voice the story of the walk to Emmaus. To
the brother and sister whose Bible knowledge was
limited to the days of their very young childhood, it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
was most interesting. They listened intently, but were
surprised to notice a tendency to whisper on the part
of some, especially the girls in the back seat, who had
been joined by three young fellows of about their own
age and caliber. Leslie, glancing over her shoulder at
the whisperers, saw they had no thrill over the story,
no interest save in their own voluble conversation.
The story went on to the point where Jesus at the table
blessed the bread, and the two men knew Him, and He
vanished out of their sight, without an interruption
in the whispering. The Great Companion had come
into the room and gone, and they had not even known it.</p>
<p>The leader rose, and cleared his voice with courage;
and then in a tone of diffidence he recited the few words
he had learned for the occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our topic to-night is &lsquo;The Great Companion:
How to Live with Him.&rsquo; It seems hard to realize that
Christ is still on the earth. That He is with us all the
time. We ought to realize this. We ought to try to
realize it. It would make our lives different if we
could realize that Christ is always with us. I expect
some of us wouldn&rsquo;t always feel comfortable if we
should find Him walking along with us, listening to
our talk. We ought to try to live so we would feel
all right if we should find Christ walking with us some
day. And I heard a story once about a boy who
had been a cripple, and he had been a great Christian;
and, when he came to die, they asked him if he was
afraid; and he said no, he wasn&rsquo;t afraid, that it was
only going into another room with Jesus. And I think
we ought to all live that way. We will now listen to
a solo by Mame Beecher, after which the meeting will
be open, and I hope that all will take part.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>It was a crude little speech, haltingly spoken, and
the speaker was evidently relieved when it was over.
Yet there had been amazing truth in what he had said,
and it came to the two visitors with the force of
newness. As he mopped his perspiring brow with
a large handkerchief and sat down, adjusting his
collar and necktie nervously, they watched him, and
marvelled again that he had been willing to be put
in so trying a position. There had been a genuineness
about him that brought conviction. This young
man really believed in Christ and that He walked
with men.</p>
<p>Allison, always ready to curl his lips over anything
sissified, sat watching him gravely. Here was a new
specimen. He didn&rsquo;t know where to place him. Did
he <i>have</i> to lead a meeting? Was he a minister&rsquo;s son
or something, or did he just do it because he wanted
to, because it seemed his duty to do it? Allison could
not decide. He knew that he himself could have made
a much better speech on the subject, but he would not
want to. He would hate it, talking about sacred things
like that out to the world; yet he was frank enough
to see that a better speech might not have been so
acceptable to God as this halting one full of repetition
and crudities.</p>
<p>The girl up by the piano was singing the solo. Why
did she let herself be called &ldquo;Mame&rdquo; in that common
way? She was a rather common-looking girl, with
loud colors in her garments and plenty of powder in
evidence on her otherwise pretty face; but she had a
good voice, and sang the words distinctly.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;In the secret of His presence how my soul delights to hide!<br />
Oh, how precious are the lessons which I learn at Jesus&rsquo; side!&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></div>
<p>The words were wonderful. They somehow held
you through to the end. The girl named Mame had
that quality of holding attention with her voice and
carrying a message to a heart. There were two lines
that seemed particularly impressive,</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;And whene&rsquo;er you leave the silence of that happy meeting-place,<br />
You must mind and bear the image of the Master in your face.&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Leslie found herself looking around the room to
see whether any one present bore that image, and her
eyes lingered longest on the quiet girl in the plain
garments over on the other side of the room. She
had a face that was almost beautiful in its repose, if it
had not worn that air of utter reticence.</p>
<p>There was a long pause after the soloist was done,
and much whispering from the back row, which at last
terminated in a flutter of Bible leaves and the reading
of three Bible verses containing the word &ldquo;companion,&rdquo;
without much reference to the topic, from the
three girls on the back seat, passing the Bible in turn,
with much ado to find their respective places. Another
hymn followed, and a prayer from a solemn-looking
boy in shell-rimmed spectacles. It was a good prayer,
but the young man wore also that air of reticence that
characterized the girl on the other side of the room,
as if he were not a part of these young people, had nothing
in common with them. Allison decided that they
were all dead, and surely did need some one to wake
them up; but the task was not to his liking. What
had he in common with a bunch like that? In fact,
what had any of them in common that they should
presume to form themselves into a society? It was rank
nonsense. You couldn&rsquo;t bring people together that had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
nothing in common and make them have a good time.
These were his thoughts during another painful pause,
during which the pastor in the back seat half rose,
then sat down and looked questioningly toward the
two visitors. The young leader seemed to understand
the signal; for he grew very red, looked at Allison
and Leslie several times, cleared his throat, turned
over his hymn-book, and finally said with painful
embarrassment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should be glad to hear from our visitors to-night.
We&rsquo;d like to know how you conduct things in
your society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted agonized eyes to Allison, and broke down
in a choking cough.</p>
<p>Allison, chilled with amazement, filled with a sudden
strange pity, looked around with growing horror to see
whether it was really true that he had been called upon
to speak in meeting. Then with the old nonchalance
that nothing ever quite daunted he rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I,&rdquo; he began, looking around with a frank
smile, &ldquo;I never was in a Christian Endeavor meeting
before in my life, and I don&rsquo;t know the first thing about
it. My sister and I only came to-night because somebody
wanted us to; so I can&rsquo;t very well tell about any
other society. But I belong to a college frat, and I
suppose it&rsquo;s a good deal the same thing in the long run.
I&rsquo;ve been reading that pledge up there on the wall. I
suppose that&rsquo;s your line. You&rsquo;ve got good dope all
right. If you live up to that, you&rsquo;re going some.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember when I first went to college the fellows
began to rush me. I had bids from two or three different
frats, and they had me going so hard I got bewildered.
I didn&rsquo;t know which I wanted to join. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
one day one of the older fellows got hold of me, and
he saw how it was with me; and he said: &lsquo;You want to
look around and analyze things. Just you look the
fellows over, and see how they size up in the different
frats. Then you see what they stand for, and how
they live up to it; and lastly you look up their alumni.&rsquo;
So I began to size things up, and I found that one frat
was all for the social doings, dances, and dinners, and
always having a good time; and another was pretty
wild, had the name of always getting in bad with the
faculty, and had the lowest marks in college; three fellows
had been expelled the year before for drunkenness
and disorderliness. Then another one was known as
ranking highest in scholarship and having the most
athletes in it. I looked over their alumni, too, for
they used to come around a good bit and get in with us
boys; and you could see just which were making good
out in the world, and which were just in life for what
they could get out of it; and I made my decision one
day just because of one big man who had been out of
college for ten years; but he had made good in the
world, and was known all over as being a successful
man and a wonderful man, and he used to come back
to every game and everything that went on at the college,
and sit around and talk with the fellows, and
encourage them; and, if anybody was falling down on
his job, he would show him where he was wrong and
how to get into line again, and even help him financially
if he got in a tight place. And so I thought with men
like that back of it that frat was a pretty good thing
to tie up to, and I joined it, and found it was even better
than I expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I was thinking as I looked at the blackboard,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
and heard you talking about the Great Companion, it
was something like that man. If all that&rsquo;s true that
you&rsquo;ve been reading and saying to-night, why, you&rsquo;ve
got pretty good things back of you. With an Alumnus
like that&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;nodding toward the blackboard&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and a
line of talk like that pledge, you sure ought to have
a drag with the world. All you&rsquo;ve got to do is to
make everybody believe that it is really so, and you&rsquo;d
have this room full; for, believe me, that&rsquo;s the kind of
dope everybody wants, especially young people, whether
they own it or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison sat down abruptly, suddenly realizing that
he had just made a religious speech and had the interest
of the meeting in his hands. His speech seemed
to set loose something in the heart of the young leader;
for he rose eagerly, alertly, his embarrassment departed,
and began to speak:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad our friend has spoken that way. I guess
it&rsquo;s all true what he has just said. We&rsquo;ve got the right
dope; only we aren&rsquo;t using it. I guess it looks mighty
like to the world as if we didn&rsquo;t really believe it all,
the way we live; but believe me, I&rsquo;m going to try to
make things different in my life this week, and see if
I can&rsquo;t make at least one person believe we have something
here they want before next Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed about to give out another hymn, but
the plain girl spoke up and interrupted him. She was
sitting forward in her chair, an almost radiant look
upon her face that quite changed it; and she spoke
rapidly, breathlessly, like a shy person who had a great
message to convey. She was looking straight at Allison
as if she had forgotten everyone else in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to speak,&rdquo; she said earnestly. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
right to keep still when I&rsquo;ve had such a wonderful experience,
and you spoke as if it might not all be true
about Christ&rsquo;s being our companion every day.&rdquo; In
spite of himself Allison met her eyes as though they
were talking alone together, and waited for what she
should tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been just a quiet Christian,&rdquo; she went
on; &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t often speak here except to recite a
Bible verse. I&rsquo;m sort of a stranger myself. But you
all ought to know what Christ has done for me. When
my people died and everything in my life was changed,
and troubles came very thick and fast, there wasn&rsquo;t anybody
in the world I could turn to for every-day help
and companionship but Jesus; and one day it came to
me how my mother used to feel about Him, and I
just went to Him, and asked Him to be my companion,
as He used to be hers. I didn&rsquo;t half believe He would
when I asked Him; but I was so hurt and alone I had
to do something; and I found out it was all true!
He helped me in so many little every-day ways, you
wouldn&rsquo;t believe it, perhaps, unless you could have
lived it out yourself. I guess you really have to live
it out to know it, after all. But I found that I could
go to Him just as if I could see Him, and I was so
surprised the first day when He answered a prayer in a
perfectly wonderful way. It all came over me, &lsquo;Why,
He loves me!&rsquo; And at first I thought it was just
happening; but I tried it again and again, and every day
wonderful things began to come into my life, and it
got to be that I could talk with Him and feel His answer
in my heart. If it were not for Him, I couldn&rsquo;t stand
life sometimes. And I&rsquo;m sure He&rsquo;ll talk with any one
that way who wants Him enough to try and find Him,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
she finished; and then, suddenly conscious of herself,
she sat back, white and shy again, with trembling lips.</p>
<p>The meeting closed then; but, while they were singing
the last hymn Allison and Leslie were watching
the face of the quiet girl with the holy, uplifted
light on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she is lovely, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; whispered
Leslie after the benediction, as they turned to go out.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; assented Allison. &ldquo;Cloudy would like
her, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to find out who she is,&rdquo; declared Leslie.</p>
<p>The minister came up just then with cordial greeting
and urgent appeal that the young people would at
once join their Christian Endeavor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a great talk you gave us to-night,&rdquo; he
said with his hand resting admiringly on Allison&rsquo;s
shoulder. &ldquo;We need young blood. You are the very
one to stir up this society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not a Christian,&rdquo; said Allison, half laughing.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t belong here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; answered the smiling minister, &ldquo;if
you take hold of the Endeavor, perhaps you&rsquo;ll find
you&rsquo;re more of a Christian than you think. Come, I
want you to meet some of our young people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young people were all gathered in groups, looking
toward the strangers, and came quite willingly to
have a nearer glimpse of them. Last of all, and by
herself, came the plain-faced girl; and the minister introduced
her as Jane Bristol. He did not speak to
her more than that, and it occurred to Allison that she
seemed as if she came more at the instigation of some
higher power than at the call of her pastor; for she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
passed quietly on again in a pleasant dignity, and did
not stop to talk and joke with her pastor as some of
the other young people had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; asked Allison, hardly aware that
he was asking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she is the daughter of a forger who died
in prison. Her mother, I believe, died of a broken
heart. Sad experience for so young a girl. She seems
to be a good little thing. She is working at housework
in town, I believe. I understand she has an idea of
entering college in the fall. You are entering college
here? That will be delightful. My wife and I will take
pleasure in calling on you as soon as you are ready to
receive visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie&rsquo;s eyes were on Jane Bristol as she moved
slowly toward the door, lingering a moment in the hall.
None of the other girls seemed to have anything to do
with her. With her usual impulsiveness Leslie left
Allison, and went swiftly down the aisle till she stood
by Jane Bristol&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to meet my aunt and stay to church.
Would you come and sit with us to-night?&rdquo; she asked
eagerly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get acquainted with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane Bristol shook her head with a wistful smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wish I could. But I
take care of a little girl evenings, and I only get off
long enough for Christian Endeavor. It&rsquo;s dear of
you to ask me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll come and see me when I get settled
in my new home, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane looked at her thoughtfully, and then gave her
a beautiful smile in answer to Leslie&rsquo;s brilliant one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you find you want me when you get settled,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; she answered, and, giving Leslie&rsquo;s little
gloved hand an impulsive squeeze, she said, &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo;
and went away.</p>
<p>Leslie looked after her a minute, half understanding,
and then turned to find her brother beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She thinks I won&rsquo;t want her because she works!&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;But I do. I shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you will, kid,&rdquo; said her brother. &ldquo;Just tell
Cloudy about her. She&rsquo;ll fix things. That old party&ndash;&ndash;I
mean, the reverend gentleman&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Allison, that isn&rsquo;t any better; and there
comes Cloudy. Don&rsquo;t make her feel bad again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, parson, then&ndash;&ndash;doesn&rsquo;t seem to have much
use for a person who&rsquo;s had the misfortune to have her
father commit forgery and her mother die of a broken
heart, or is it because she has to work her way through
college? He may be all right, sister; but I&rsquo;d bank
on that girl&rsquo;s religion over against his any day in the
week, Sundays included.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Julia Cloud came up the steps, and they went
in to a rather dreary evening service with a sparse
congregation and a bored-looking choir, who passed
notes and giggled during the sermon. Allison and
Leslie sat and wondered what kind of a shock it would
be to them all if the Great Companion should suddenly
become visible in the room. If all that about
His being always present was true, it certainly was a
startling thing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>
<p>The next morning dawned with a dull, dreary
drizzle coming noisily down on the red and
yellow leaves of the maple by the window; but
the three rose joyously and their ardor was not damped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work,&rdquo;
quoted Allison at the breakfast-table. &ldquo;Cloudy, we&rsquo;ve
got to hustle. Do you mind if it does rain? We&rsquo;ve
got our car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Julia Cloud smiled unconcernedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should worry,&rdquo; she said with a gay imitation
of Leslie&rsquo;s inimitable toss of the head, and the two
young people laughed so hilariously that the other
staid couples already in the dining-room turned in
amaze to see who was taking life so happily on a day
like this.</p>
<p>They piled into the car, and hied themselves to
town at once, chattering joyfully over their list as to
which things they would buy first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s begin with the kitchen,&rdquo; said Leslie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
crazy to learn how to make cookies. Cloudy, you&rsquo;ll
teach me how so I can make some all myself,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And waffles!&rdquo; said Allison from the front seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um-mmm-mmmm! I remember Cloudy&rsquo;s waffles.
And buckwheat cakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have everything for the kitchen
to make things easy, so that when we can&rsquo;t get a maid
Cloudy won&rsquo;t be always overdoing,&rdquo; said Leslie.
&ldquo;Guardy told me especially about that. He said we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
were to get every convenience to make things easy,
so the cook wouldn&rsquo;t leave; for he&rsquo;d rather pay any
amount than have Cloudy work herself to death and
have to break down and leave us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was the house-furnishing department of the
great store to which they first repaired, and there they
hovered for two hours among tins and aluminum and
wooden ware, discussing the relative charms of white-enamel
refrigerators and gas-ranges, vacuum cleaners
and dish-washers, the new ideas against the old. Julia
Cloud was for careful buying and getting along with
few things; the children were infatuated with the idea
of a kitchen of their own, and wanted everything in
sight. They went wild over a new kind of refrigerator
that would freeze its own ice, making ice-cream in the
bargain, and run by an electric motor; but here Julia
Cloud held firm. No such expensive experiment was
needed in their tiny kitchen. A small white, old-fashioned
kind was good enough for them. So the
children immediately threw their enthusiasm into selecting
the best kind of ice-cream freezer.</p>
<p>When they finally went to the tea-room for lunch,
everything on Julia Cloud&rsquo;s list was carefully checked
off by Allison with its respective price; and, while they
were waiting to be served, he added the column twice
to make sure he was right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re shy five dollars yet of what we planned
to spend on our kitchen, Cloudy,&rdquo; he announced
radiantly. &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where would you have been if I had let you
get that refrigerator?&rdquo; she retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there were a lot of things we didn&rsquo;t really
need,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Such as what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, clothes-pins and&ndash;&ndash;well, all those pans. Did
you need so many?&rdquo; he answered helplessly.</p>
<p>They laughed his masculine judgment out of countenance,
and chatted away about what they should do
next, until their order arrived.</p>
<p>They were like three children as they ate their
lunch, recalling now and then some purchase which gave
them particular pleasure.</p>
<p>Suddenly Julia Cloud lifted her hands in mock
distress. &ldquo;I know what we&rsquo;ve forgotten! Dish-towels!&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dish-towels! Why, sure. We have to have a
lot so we can all wipe dishes when the cook goes out.
Will five dollars buy them, Cloudy?&rdquo; asked Leslie
distressingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I certainly should hope so!&rdquo; said Julia
Cloud, laughing. &ldquo;The idea! Five dollars&rsquo; worth
of dish-towels!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll go and get them at once,&rdquo; said Leslie;
&ldquo;and after that we&rsquo;ll do the bedrooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five o&rsquo;clock found them wending their way homeward
once more, tired but happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, to-morrow,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud, leaning back
on the soft cushions, &ldquo;I think we had better stay at
home and receive the things. The house must be
cleaned at once, and then we can put things right where
they are going to belong. Allison, you ought to be
able to get a man to wash windows. I&rsquo;ll ask the
chambermaid about a woman to help clean, and Leslie
and I will make curtains while you put up the rods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were so interesting a trio at their table in
the inn dining-room that night that people around began
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
to ask who were those two charming young people and
their beautiful mother. Little ripples of query went
around the room as they entered, for they were indeed
noticeable anywhere. The young people were bubbling
over with life and spirits and kindliness, and
Julia Cloud in her silvery robes and her white hair
made a pleasant picture. But they were so wholly
wrapped up in their own housekeeping plans that they
were utterly unaware of the interest they excited in
their fellow-boarders. Just at present they had no
time to spare on other people. They were playing a
game, just as they used to play house when they were
little, with their aunt; and they wanted no interruption
until they should have completed the home and were
ready to move in and begin to live. After that other
people might come in for their attention.</p>
<p>The next morning bright and early Allison was
up and out, hunting his man, and announced triumphantly
at the breakfast-table that he was found and
would be down at the house and ready for work in half
an hour. Breakfast became a brief ceremony after
that. For Julia Cloud also had not been idle, and had
procured the address of a good woman to clean the
house. Allison rushed off after the car, and in a few
minutes they were on their way, first to leave Julia
Cloud and Leslie at the house to superintend the man,
and then to hunt the woman. He presently returned
with a large colored woman sitting imposingly in the
back seat, her capable hands folded in her lap, a look
of intense satisfaction on her ample countenance.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud had thoughtfully brought from home a
large bundle of cleaning-rags, and a little canned-alcohol
heater presently supplied hot water. Leslie made a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
voyage of discovery, and purchased soap and scouring-powder;
and soon the whole little house was a hive
of workers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud, opening the bundle of
curtain material, &ldquo;where shall we begin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right here,&rdquo; said Leslie, looking around the big
white living-room with satisfaction. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just longing
to see this look like a home; and you must admit,
Cloudy, that this room is the real heart of the house.
We&rsquo;ll eat and sleep and work and study in the other
rooms; but here we&rsquo;ll really live, right around that
dear fireplace. I&rsquo;m just crazy to see it made up and
burning. Oh, won&rsquo;t it be great?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Busy hands and shining scissors went to work,
measuring, cutting, turning hems; and presently a neat
pile of white curtains, the hems all turned ready for
stitching, lay in the wide back window-seat. Then they
went at the other rooms, the sun-porch room and the
dining-room. But before that was quite finished a large
furniture-truck arrived, and behold the sewing-machine
had come! Leslie was so eager to get at it that she
could hardly wait until the rest of the load was properly
disposed.</p>
<p>She was not an experienced sewer, but she brought
to her work an enthusiasm that stood loyally beside
her aunt&rsquo;s experience, and soon some of the curtains
were up.</p>
<p>They could not bear to stop and go back to the
inn for lunch; so Allison ran down to the pie-shop with
the car, and brought back buns cut into halves and
buttered, with great slices of ham in them, a pail of hot
sweetened coffee, a big cocoanut pie, a bag of cakes
and a basket of grapes; and they made a picnic of it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Our first meal in our own house! Isn&rsquo;t it great?&rdquo;
cried Leslie, dancing around with a roll sandwich in one
hand and a wedge of pie in the other.</p>
<p>By night every clean little window in that many-windowed
house was curtained with white drapery,
and in some rooms also with inner curtains of soft silk.
The house began to look cozy in spite of its emptiness,
and they could hardly bear to leave it when sunset
warned them that it was getting near dinner-time and
they must return to the inn to freshen up for
the evening.</p>
<p>Another day at the little house completed the cleaning
and curtaining, and by this time all the furniture so
far purchased had arrived, and they had no need to
be there to watch for anything else; so another day of
shopping was agreed upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I move we pick out the piano first of all,&rdquo;
said Leslie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just crazy to get my fingers on the
keys again, and you don&rsquo;t know how well Allison can
sing, Cloudy. You just ought to hear him. Oh, boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud smiled adoringly at the two, and agreed
that the piano was as good a place as any to begin.</p>
<p>That day was the best of all the wonderful shopping
to Julia Cloud. To be actually picking out wonderful
mahogany furniture such as she had seen occasionally
in houses of the rich, such as she had admired in
pictures and read of in magazine articles, seemed too
wonderful to be true. For the first time in her life she
was to live among beautiful things, and she felt as if
she had stepped into at least the anteroom of heaven.
It troubled her a little to be allowing the children to
spend so much, even though their guardian had made
it plain that they had plenty to spend; for it did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
seem quite right to use so much on one&rsquo;s self when
so many were in need; but gradually her viewpoint
began to change. It was true that these things were
only relative, and what seemed much to her was little
to another. Perhaps coming directly from her exceedingly
limited sphere she was no fit judge of what was
right and necessary. And of course there was always
the fact that good things lasted, and were continually
beautiful if well chosen. Also much good might be
done to a large circle of outsiders by a beautiful home.</p>
<p>So Julia Cloud, because the matter of expenditure
was not, after all, in her hands, decided just to have
a good time and enjoy picking out these wonderful
things, interfering only where she thought the article
the children selected was not worth buying, or was
foolish and useless. But on the whole they got along
beautifully, and agreed most marvellously about what
fitted the little pink-and-white stone &ldquo;villa,&rdquo; as Leslie
had named it. &ldquo;&lsquo;Cloud Villa,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll call
it,&rdquo; she cried one day in sudden inspiration; and so it
was called thereafter in loving jest.</p>
<p>Two days more of hard work, and their list was
nearly finished. By this time they were almost weary
of continually trying to decide which thing to get.
A bewildering jumble of French gray bedsteads and
mahogany tables and dining-room chairs swung around
in their minds when they went to sleep at night, and
smilingly met their waking thoughts. They were beginning
to long for the time when they could sit down
in the dining-room chairs, and get acquainted with their
beds and tables, and feel at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could get in by Sunday,&rdquo; grumbled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
Allison. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fierce hanging around this hotel with
nothing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo; assented Julia Cloud as she
buttered her breakfast muffin. &ldquo;The bedding was
promised to come out this morning, and I don&rsquo;t see
why we couldn&rsquo;t make up the beds and sleep there
to-night, although I don&rsquo;t know whether we can get the
gas-range connected in time to do much cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can come back here for our meals till next
week,&rdquo; declared Leslie. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have time to get
the dishes unpacked and washed and put in that lovely
china-closet. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll be able to get at that to-day.
The curtains are every blessed one up, inside and out,
now; and, if we succeed in getting that maid that you
heard of, why, we&rsquo;ll be all fixed for next week. I
do wish those California things would arrive and we
could get the rugs down. It doesn&rsquo;t look homey without
rugs and pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, sure enough, they had not been at work ten
minutes before the newly-acquired telephone bell rang,
and the freight agent announced that their goods were
at the station, and asked whether they wanted them
sent up to-day, for he wanted to get the car out of
his way.</p>
<p>In two hours more the goods arrived, and right in
the midst of their unloading the delivery-wagons from
the city brought a lot more articles; and so the little
pink-and-white house was a scene of lively action for
some time.</p>
<p>When the last truck had started away from the
house, Allison drove the car up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Cloudy, you jump in quick, and we&rsquo;re going
back to the inn for lunch. Then you lie down and rest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
a whole hour, and sleep, or I won&rsquo;t let you come
back,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I saw a tired look around
your eyes, and it won&rsquo;t do. We are not going to have
you worked out, not if we stay in that old inn for
another month. So there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He packed them in, and whirled them away to the
inn in spite of Julia Cloud&rsquo;s protest that she was not
tired and wanted to work; but, when they came back at
two o&rsquo;clock, they all felt rested and fit for work again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m the man, and I&rsquo;m going to boss for a
while,&rdquo; said Allison. &ldquo;You two ladies go up-stairs,
and make beds. Here, which are the blankets and
sheets? I&rsquo;ll take the bundles right up there, and you
won&rsquo;t have any running up and down to do. These?
All of them? All right. Now come on up, and I&rsquo;ll be
undoing the rugs and boxes from California. When
you come down, they&rsquo;ll be all ready for you to say
where they shall go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie and her aunt laughingly complied, and had a
beautiful time unfolding and spreading the fine white
sheets, plumping the new pillows into their cases, laying
the soft, gay-bordered blankets and pretty white
spreads, till each bed was fair and fit for a good night&rsquo;s
sleep. And then at the foot of each was plumped, in
a puff of beauty, the bright satin eiderdowns that
Leslie had insisted upon. Rose-color for Julia Cloud&rsquo;s,
robin&rsquo;s-egg blue for Leslie&rsquo;s, and orange and brown for
Allison&rsquo;s, who had insisted upon mahogany and quiet
colors for his room. Leslie&rsquo;s furniture was ivory-white,
and Julia Cloud&rsquo;s room was furnished in French
gray enamel, with insets of fine cane-work. She stood
a moment in the open doorway, and looked about the
place; soft gray walls, with a trellis of roses at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
top, filmy white draperies with a touch of rose, a gray
couch luxuriously upholstered, with many pillows, some
rose, some gray, a thick, gray rug under her feet, and
her own little gray desk drawn out conveniently when
she wanted to write. Over all a flood of autumn
sunshine, and on the wall a great water-color of a
marvellous sunset that Leslie had insisted belonged in
that room and must be bought or the furnishing would
not be complete.</p>
<p>It filled Julia Cloud&rsquo;s eyes with tears of wonder and
gratitude to think that such a princess&rsquo;s abode should
have come to be her abiding-place after her long years
of barren living in dreary surroundings. She lifted
her eyes to the sunset picture on the wall, and it
reminded her of the evening when she had stood at her
own home window in her distress and sorrow, looking
into the gray future, and had watched it break into
rose-color before her eyes. For just an instant after
Leslie had run down-stairs she closed her door, and
dropped upon her knees beside the lovely bed to thank
her Lord for this green and pleasant pasture where He
had led her tired feet.</p>
<p>Allison had all the rugs spread out on the porch
and lawn, and he and Leslie were hard at work giving
them a good sweeping. They were wonderful rugs,
just such as one would expect to come from a home
of wealth where money had never been a consideration.
Julia Cloud looked at them almost with awe, recognizing
by instinct the priceless worth of them, and almost
afraid at the idea of living a common, daily life on
them. For Julia Cloud had read about rugs. She
knew that in far lands poor peasant people, whole families,
sometimes wove their history into them for a mere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
pittance; and they had come to mean something almost
sacred in her thoughts.</p>
<p>But Allison and Leslie had no such reverence for
them; and they swept away gayly, and slammed them
about familiarly, in a happy hurry to get them in place.
So presently the big blue Chinese rug covered the living-room,
almost literally; for it was an immense one, and
left very little margin around it. A handsome Kermanshah
in old rose and old gold with pencillings
of black was spread forth under the mahogany dining-table,
and a rich dark-red and black Bokhara runner
fitted the porch-room as if it had been bought for it.
The smaller rugs were quickly disposed here and
there, a lovely little rose-colored silk prayer rug being
forced upon Julia Cloud for her bedroom as just the
finishing touch it needed, and Leslie took possession
of two or three smaller blue rugs for her room. Then
they turned their attention to pictures, bits of jade and
bronze, a few rare pieces of furniture, a wonderful
old bronze lamp with a great dragon on a sea of wonderful
blue enamel, with a shade that cast an amber light;
brass andirons and fender, and a lot of other little
things that go to make a lovely home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Allison, &ldquo;when we get our books unpacked,
and some magazines thrown around, it will
look like living. Cloudy, can we sleep here to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, surely,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud with a child-like
delight in her eyes. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to hinder? I feel as if
I was in a dream, and if I didn&rsquo;t go right on playing
it was true I would wake up and find it all gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they rode back to the inn for their supper, hurried
their belongings into the trunk, and moved bag
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
and baggage into the new house at nine o&rsquo;clock on
Saturday night.</p>
<p>While Leslie and her aunt were up-stairs putting
away their clothes from the trunk into the new closets
and bureau-drawers, Allison brought in a few kindlings,
and made a bit of a fire on the hearth; and now he
called them down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to have a housewarming the first night,
Cloudy,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Come down and see how it all
looks in the firelight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the two came down-stairs, and all three sat together
on the deep-blue velvet settee in front of the
fireplace, Julia Cloud in the middle and a child on
either side.</p>
<p>They were all very tired and did not say much,
just sat together happily, watching the wood blaze
up and flicker and fall into embers. Presently both
children nestled closer to her, and put down a head
on each of her shoulders. So they sat for a long
time quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud, as the fire died down
and the room grew dusky with shadows, &ldquo;it is time we
went to bed. But there is something I wish we could
do this first night in our new home. Don&rsquo;t you think
we ought to dedicate it to God, or at least thank God
for giving it to us? Would you be willing to kneel
down with me, and&ndash;&ndash;we might just all pray silently,
if you don&rsquo;t feel like praying out loud. Would you
be willing to do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a tender silence for a moment while
the children thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; growled Allison huskily. &ldquo;You pray
out, Cloudy. We&rsquo;d like it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; whispered Leslie, nestling her hand in
her aunt&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And so, trembling, half fearful, her heart in her
throat, but bravely, Julia Cloud knelt with a child on
either side, hiding wondering, embarrassed, but
loyal faces.</p>
<p>There was a tense silence while Julia Cloud struggled
for words to break through her unwilling lips, and
then quite softly she breathed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O dear Christ, come and dwell in this home, and
bless it. Help us to live to please Thee. Help me
to be a wise guide to these dear children&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, her voice suddenly giving way with a
nervous choke in her throat, and two young hands
instantly squeezed her hands in sympathy.</p>
<p>Then a gruff young voice burst out on one side,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me to be good, and not hurt her or make it
hard for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Leslie gasped out, &ldquo;And me, too, dear God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a moment more, and they all rose, tears on
their faces. In the dying firelight they kissed Julia
Cloud fervently, and said good-night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>
<p>Leslie and Allison did not go to the Christian
Endeavor meeting that second Sunday. They
were tired out, and wanted to stay at home all
the evening, and Julia Cloud felt that it would be unwise
to urge them; so they sat around the fire and talked.
Leslie sat down at the new piano, and played softly old
hymns that Julia Cloud hummed; and they all went to
bed early, having had a happy Sabbath in their
new home.</p>
<p>But Monday evening quite early, just after they
had come back from supper and were talking about
reading a story aloud, there came a knock at the door.
Their first caller! And behold, there stood the inefficient-looking
young man who had led the Christian
Endeavor meeting, the boy with the goggles who had
prayed, and the two girls who had sat by the piano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a committee,&rdquo; announced the young man,
quite embarrassed. &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Herricote, Joe
Herricote. I&rsquo;m president of our Christian Endeavor
Society, and this is Roy Bryan; he&rsquo;s the secretary.
This is Mame Beecher. I guess you remember her
singing. She&rsquo;s chairman of our social committee, and
Lila Cary&rsquo;s our pianist and chairman of the music committee.
We&rsquo;ve come to see if you won&rsquo;t help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Allison cordially, but with a
growing disappointment. Now, here were these dull
people coming to interrupt their pleasant evening, and
there wouldn&rsquo;t be many of them, for college would
soon begin, and they would be too busy then to read
stories and just enjoy themselves.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></div>
<p>Leslie, too, frowned, but came forward politely to
be introduced. She knew at a glance that these were
not people of the kind she cared to have for friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a committee,&rdquo; repeated young Herricote,
sitting down on the edge of a chair, and looking around
most uncomfortably at the luxurious apartment. He
had not realized it would be like this. He was beginning
to feel like a fish out of water. As for the rest
of the committee, they were overawed and dumb, all
except the little fellow with the tortoise-rimmed glasses.
He was not looking at anything but Allison, and was
intent on his mission. When he saw that his superior
had been struck dumb, he took up the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They appointed us to come and interview you,
and see if you wouldn&rsquo;t give us some new ideas how
to run our society so it would be a success,&rdquo; he put in.
&ldquo;They all liked your speech so much the other night
they felt you could help us out of the rut we&rsquo;ve
got into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; asked Allison, laughing incredulously.
&ldquo;Why, I told you I didn&rsquo;t know the first thing about
Christian Endeavor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve gotta have your help,&rdquo; said the young
secretary earnestly. &ldquo;This thing&rsquo;s gotta go! It&rsquo;s
needed in our church, and it&rsquo;s the only thing in the
town to help some of the young people. It&rsquo;s just
<i>gotta</i> go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you feel that way, you&rsquo;ll make it go,
I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; encouraged Allison. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just the kind
of a fellow to make it go. You know all about it. Not
I. I never heard of the thing till last week, except just
in a casual way. Don&rsquo;t know much about it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, s&rsquo;pose it was one of your frats, and it wasn&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
succeeding. What would you do? You saw what kind
of a dead-and-alive meeting we had, only a few there,
and nobody taking much interest. How would you
pull up a frat that was that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Allison, speaking at random, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
look around, and find some of the right kind of fellows,
and rush &rsquo;em. Get in some new blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Bryan doggedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
rushin&rsquo; you. How do you do it? I never went to college
yet; so I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison laughed now. He rather liked this
queer boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nut!&rdquo; he said to himself, and entered into
the talk in earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you have parties, and rides, and good times
generally, and invite a fellow, and make him feel at
home, and make him want to belong. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Bryan, with a twinkling glance at the
rest of his committee. &ldquo;We have a party down at my
house Friday night. Will you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison saw that the joke was on him, and his
reserve broke down entirely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess it&rsquo;s up to me to come,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m game. I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bryan turned his big goggles on Leslie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, if Allison does, I will,&rdquo; agreed
Leslie, dimpling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Bryan, turning back to
Allison. &ldquo;Now, what do you do when you rush?
You&rsquo;ll have to teach us how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Allison thoughtfully, &ldquo;we generally
pick out our best rushers, the ones that can talk best,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
and put them wise. We never let the fellow that&rsquo;s
rushed know what we&rsquo;re doing. Oh, if he has brains,
he always knows, of course; but you don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re
rushing him in so many words. At college we meet a
fellow at the train, and show him around the place,
and put him onto all the little things that will make it
easy for him; and we invite him to eat with us, and
help him out in every way we can. We appoint some
one to look after him specially, and a certain group
have him in their charge so the other frats won&rsquo;t
have a chance to rush him&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. The other frats being represented by the
devil, I suppose,&rdquo; said the round-eyed boy keenly without
a smile.</p>
<p>Allison stared at him, and then broke into a
laugh again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got onto the idea.
It&rsquo;s your society over against the other things that can
draw them away from what you stand for. See? And
then there&rsquo;s another thing. You want to have something
ready to show them when you get them there.
That&rsquo;s where our alumni come in. They often run
down to college for a few days and help us out with
money and influence and experience. If you&rsquo;ve got
good working alumni, you&rsquo;re right in it, you see. We
generally appoint a committee to talk things over with
the alumni.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; said Bryan, drawing his brows together
in a comical way behind his goggles, &ldquo;you
mean&ndash;&ndash;pray, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Allison, flushing, &ldquo;I suppose that
would be a good idea. I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it just
in that way.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You called Christ our alumnus the other night,&rdquo;
reminded the literal youth solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did,&rdquo; acknowledged Allison embarrassedly.
&ldquo;Well, I guess you&rsquo;re right. But I don&rsquo;t know much
about that kind of line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there don&rsquo;t many of us,&rdquo; put in the
bashful president. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t hardly know who
to appoint on such a committee. There&rsquo;s only two or
three like to pray in our meetings. There&rsquo;s Bryan; we
always ask him because he doesn&rsquo;t mind, and I&ndash;&ndash;well, I
do sometimes when there&rsquo;s no one else, but it comes
hard; and there&rsquo;s old Miss Ferby, but she always prays
so long, and gets in the president and all the missionary
stations&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you&rsquo;d ask that Jane Bristol,&rdquo; spoke
up Leslie earnestly. &ldquo;I know she must be able to. She
talked that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose she would,&rdquo; responded the president
hesitatingly, looking toward the two ladies of the committee
with a half apology. &ldquo;What do you girls
think about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose she could <i>pray</i>,&rdquo; said the girl called
Mame, with a shrug. &ldquo;She does, you know, often
in meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then with a giggle toward Leslie she added as if in
explanation, &ldquo;She works <i>out</i>, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be very hard for her,&rdquo; said Leslie, purposely
ignoring the inference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know she isn&rsquo;t in our set. Nobody
has much to do with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? I think she is very unusual,&rdquo; said
Leslie with just the least bit of hauteur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it wouldn&rsquo;t be wise to get her into things.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
It might keep some others out if we made her prominent,&rdquo;
put in Lila Cary with some asperity. &ldquo;We must
have some social distinction, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In our frat one fellow is as good as another if
he has the right kind of character,&rdquo; remarked Allison
dryly. &ldquo;That girl sounded to me as if she had some
drag with your alumni. But of course you know her
better than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a good girl all right and real religious,&rdquo;
hastened Lila to amend. &ldquo;I suppose she&rsquo;d be real good
on a prayer committee, and would help to fill up there,
as you haven&rsquo;t many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing,&rdquo; said Allison, &ldquo;if
you really want to succeed, you&rsquo;ve got to pull together,
every member of you, or you won&rsquo;t get anywhere.
And I should think that you&rsquo;d have to be careful now
at first whom you get in. Of course after you&rsquo;re pretty
strong you can take in a few just to help them; but, if
you get in too many of that lame kind, your society&rsquo;ll
go bad. The weak kind will rule, and the mischief will
be to pay. I shouldn&rsquo;t think it would help you any
just now to get in any folks that would feel that way
about a good girl just because she earns her living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mame Beecher and Lila Cary looked at each other
in alarm, and hastened to affirm that they never felt
that way about Jane Bristol. <i>They</i> thought she was a
real good sort, and had always meant to get acquainted
with her; only she always slipped out as soon as meeting
was over.</p>
<p>Back in the dining-room behind the rose-lined blue-velvet
hangings Julia Cloud lingered and smiled over
the way her two children were developing opinions and
character. How splendid of them to take this stand!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
And who was Jane Bristol? Assuredly she must be
looked up and helped if that was the way the town
felt about her, poor child!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bryan in a business-like tone, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
secretary. Joe, you call that prayer committee together
Thursday night at your house at half-past seven,
and I&rsquo;ll send a notice to each one. You make Jane
Bristol chairman, and I&rsquo;ll be on the committee; and
I&rsquo;ll go after her and take her home. Now, who else
are you going to have on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The president assented readily. He was one not
used to taking the initiative, but he eagerly did as he
was told when a good idea presented itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want you on it,&rdquo; he said, nodding to Allison
and then, looking shyly at Leslie, added, &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Leslie, flushing in fright, &ldquo;what would
we have to do? I never prayed before anybody in my
life. I&rsquo;m not sure I even know how to pray, only
just to say &lsquo;Thank you&rsquo; to God sometimes. I think
you could find somebody better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to have you this time,&rdquo; said the president,
shaking his head. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t pray if you
don&rsquo;t want to, but you must come and help us through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t go and be a&ndash;&ndash;a sort of slacker!&rdquo;
said Leslie, her cheeks quite beautifully red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right! You come!&rdquo; said Bryan, looking
solemnly at her.</p>
<p>When the visitors finally took themselves away,
Allison, polite to the last, closed the door with a courteous
&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; and then stood frowning at the fire.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud came softly into the room, and went
and stood beside him with loving question in her eyes.
He met her gaze with a new kind of hardness.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you see what you let me in for, Cloudy,
when you made me go to that little old dull Christian
Endeavor! But I won&rsquo;t do it! That&rsquo;s all there is to it.
You needn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to. The idea! Why,
what did we come here to college for? To run an
asylum for sick Sunday schools, I&rsquo;d like to know? As
if I had time to monkey with their little old society!
It&rsquo;s rank nonsense, anyhow! What good do they think
they can do, a couple of sissies, and two or three kid
vamps, setting up to lisp religion? It&rsquo;s ridiculous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was working himself up into a fine frenzy.
Julia Cloud stood and watched him, an amused smile
growing on her sweet lips. He caught the amusement,
and fired up at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you looking like that at me for, Cloudy?
You know it is. You know it&rsquo;s all foolishness. And
you know I couldn&rsquo;t help them, anyhow. Come, now,
don&rsquo;t you? <i>What</i> are you looking like that for, Cloudy?
I believe you&rsquo;re laughing at me! You think I&rsquo;ll go and
get into this thing, but I&rsquo;ll show you. I <i>won&rsquo;t</i>! And
that&rsquo;s an end of it. Cloudy, I insist on knowing what
you find to laugh at in this situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I was just thinking how much you reminded
me of Moses,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud sweetly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of <i>Moses</i>!&rdquo; screamed Allison half angrily.
&ldquo;Why, he was a meek man, and I&rsquo;m not meek. I&rsquo;m
mad! Out and out <i>mad</i>, Cloudy. What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, he wasn&rsquo;t always meek,&rdquo; said his aunt
thoughtfully; &ldquo;and he talked just as you are doing
when God called on him first to lead the children of
Israel out of Egypt. He said he couldn&rsquo;t and he
wouldn&rsquo;t and he shouldn&rsquo;t, and made every excuse in
the calendar; and finally God had to send along Aaron
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
to help him, although God had said <i>He</i> would be with
him and make him perfectly able alone to do what He
wanted done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m Aaron,&rdquo; sighed Leslie, settling into
a big chair by the fire. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t like those girls one
bit! And I don&rsquo;t care if they stay in seven Egypts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Cloudy Jewel,&rdquo; pleaded Allison.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to get me into any such corner as
that. The idea that God would call me to do any of
His work when I never had anything at all to do with
the church in my life, and I don&rsquo;t want to. How should
I know what to do? Why should He ever call me, I&rsquo;d
like to know, when I don&rsquo;t know the first thing about
churches? You&rsquo;re all off, Cloudy. Think again. Why,
I&rsquo;m not even what you&rsquo;d call a Christian. He surely
wouldn&rsquo;t call people that haven&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;well, what you&rsquo;d
call enlisted with Him, would He?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might,&rdquo; answered Julia Cloud reflectively.
She was sitting on the end of the big blue couch, and
the firelight played over her white hair with silvery
lights, and cast a lovely rose tint over her sweet face.
&ldquo;There were several instances where He called people
who had never known Him at all, who, in fact, were
worshipping idols and strange gods, and told them
to go and do something for Him. There was Paul;
he was actually against Him. And there was Abraham;
he lived among regular idol-worshippers, and God
called him to go into a strange land and founded a new
family for him, the beginning of the peculiar people
through whose line was to come Jesus, the Saviour of
the world. And Abraham went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense, Cloudy! That was in those times.
Of course. There wasn&rsquo;t anybody else, I suppose; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
He had to take some one. But now there are plenty
of people who go to church all the time and like that
sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know, Allison? Perhaps you are
the only one in this town, and God has sent you here
just to do this special work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t, and that&rsquo;s flat, Cloudy; so you can
put the idea right out of your head. I won&rsquo;t, not even
for you. Anything that has to do with your personal
comfort I wouldn&rsquo;t say that about, of course; but this
belongs entirely to that little old ratty church, and I
haven&rsquo;t anything at all to do with it; and I want you to
forget it, Cloudy, for <i>I&rsquo;m not going to do it</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Allison, you&rsquo;re mistaken about me. It isn&rsquo;t
my affair, and I don&rsquo;t intend to make it so. I didn&rsquo;t
get this up. It&rsquo;s between you and God. If God really
called you, you&rsquo;ll have to say no to Him, not to me.
I don&rsquo;t intend to make excuses to God for you, child.
You needn&rsquo;t think it. And, besides, there&rsquo;s another
thing you&rsquo;re very much mistaken about, and that is
that you haven&rsquo;t anything to do with the church. When
you were a little baby six months old, your father and
mother brought you home to our house; and the first
Sunday they were there they took you to the old church
where all the children and grandchildren had been
christened for years, and they stood up and assented to
the vows that gave you to God. And they promised
for themselves that they would do their best to bring
you up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord
until you came to years and could finish the bond by
giving yourself to the Lord. I shall never forget the
sweet, serious look on the face of your lovely girl-mother
when she bowed her head in answer to the
minister&rsquo;s question, &lsquo;Do you thus promise?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></div>
<p>Allison had stopped in his angry walk up and down
the room, and was looking at her interestedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that right, Cloudy? Was I baptized in the old
Sterling church? I never knew that. Tell me about
it,&rdquo; and he seated himself on the other end of the
couch, while Leslie switched off the light and nestled
down between them, scenting a story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t I, too, Cloudy?&rdquo; she asked hungrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear, I think you were baptized in California
in your mother&rsquo;s church, and I&rsquo;m sorry to say I wasn&rsquo;t
there to see; so I can&rsquo;t tell you about it; but I remember
very distinctly all about Allison&rsquo;s christening, for we
were all so happy to have it happen in the East, and
he was the first grandchild, and we hadn&rsquo;t seen your
father for over two years, nor ever seen his young wife
before; so it was a great event. It was a beautiful
bright October day, and I had the pleasure of making
the dress you wore, Allison, every stitch by hand,
hemstitching and embroidery and all. And right in the
midst of the ceremony you looked over your father&rsquo;s
shoulder, and saw me sitting in the front seat, and
smiled the sweetest smile! Then you jumped up and
down in your father&rsquo;s arms, and spatted your little pink
hands together, and called out &lsquo;Ah-<i>Jah</i>!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what
you used to call me then, and everybody all over the
church smiled. How could they help it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! I must &rsquo;a&rsquo; been some kid!&rdquo; said Allison,
slipping down into a comfortable position among the
pillows. &ldquo;Say, Cloudy, I knew a good thing when I
saw it even then, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Allison, that ceremony wasn&rsquo;t just
all on your father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s part; it entailed some
responsibility upon you. It was part of your heritage,
and you&rsquo;ve no right to waste it any more than if it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
were gold or bank stock or houses and lands. It was
your title to a heavenly sonship, and it gave God the
right to call upon you to do whatever He wants you to
do. It&rsquo;s between you and God now, and you&rsquo;ll have
to settle it yourself. It&rsquo;s not anything I could settle
for you either way, much as I might want it, because
it is you who must answer God, and you must answer
Him from the heart either way; so nobody else has
anything to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good-<i>night</i>! Cloudy, you certainly can put
things in an awkward way. Oh, hang it! Now this
whole evening&rsquo;s spoiled. I wish I hadn&rsquo;t gone to the
front door at all. I wish I&rsquo;d turned out the lights
and let &rsquo;em knock. And there was that story you
were going to read, and now it&rsquo;s too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no; it&rsquo;s not too late at all,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud,
consulting her little watch in the firelight. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only
quarter to nine, and I&rsquo;m sure we can indulge ourselves
a little to-night, and finish the story before we go to
bed. Turn the light on, and get the magazine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an air of finality Julia Cloud put aside the
debated question, and settled herself in the big willow
chair by the lamp with her book. Leslie went back
to her chair by the fire, and Allison flung himself down
on the couch with a pillow half over his eyes; but anybody
watching closely would have seen that his eyes
were wide open and he was studying the calm, quiet
profile of his aunt&rsquo;s sweet face as she read in a gentle,
even tone, paragraph after paragraph without a flicker
of disturbance on her brow. Allison was not more than
half listening to the story. He was thinking hard.
Those things Julia Cloud had said about obligations and
Moses and Abraham and Paul stuck hard in his mind,
and he couldn&rsquo;t get away from them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>
<p>Julia Cloud said nothing more to her boy about
that Christian Endeavor Society, but she said
much to her Lord, praying continually that he
might be led to see his duty and want to do it, and that
through it he might be led to know Christ.</p>
<p>In the meantime she went sunnily about setting the
new home to rights and getting the right maid to fit
into their household r&eacute;gime. Julia Cloud had never
had a maid in her life, but she had always had ideas
about one, and she put as much thought and almost as
much care into preparing the little chamber the maid
was to occupy as she had put upon the other rooms.
To begin with, the room itself was admirably adapted
to making the right maid feel at home and comfortable.
It had three windows looking into gardens on the next
block, and a blaze of salvia and cosmos and geraniums
would greet her eyes the first time she looked out from
her new room. Then it had a speck of a bathroom
all its own, which Julia Cloud felt would go a long
way toward making any maid the right maid, for there
would be no excuse for her not being clean and no
excuse for her keeping her tooth-brush down on the
edge of the kitchen sink or taking a bath in the laundry
tubs, as she had heard that some of her neighbors&rsquo; maids
had done at various times.</p>
<p>The windows were shrouded with white curtains
of the same kind as those all over the house, and within
were draperies with bright flower borders. The bureau
was daintily fitted out, and the bed was spotless and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
inviting-looking. A cushioned rocking-chair stood beside
a small table, with a dainty work-basket on the
shelf below; and against the wall were some shelves
with a few interesting books and magazines. A droplight
with a pretty shade gave a home-like air, and the
room was as attractive as any other in the house. Any
maid might think her lines had fallen in pleasant places
who was fortunate enough to occupy that room. As
a last touch Julia Cloud laid a neat coarse-print Testament
on the table, and then knelt beside the rocking-chair
and asked God to make the unknown comer a
blessing to their house, and help them all to be a
blessing to her. Then she went down to the car, and
let Allison take her out to the addresses that had been
given her. As a result, by Wednesday the little gay
chamber half-way up the stairs was occupied by a
pleasant-faced, sturdy colored girl about eighteen years
old, who rejoiced in the name of Cherry, and was
at once adopted as part of the new household with the
same spirit with which everything else had been done.
Perhaps if every household would go about it in the
same way it would go far toward settling the much-mooted
servant question.</p>
<p>When Cherry was introduced into her bedchamber
the look on her face was worth seeing. It was in the
early evening when she arrived, riding on the front
seat of the wagon that brought her trunk; and, when
she was ushered in by Julia Cloud, with Leslie in the
offing to see what the newcomer would say to it, the girl
stepped in, gave a wild glance around, then backed off,
and rolled her eyes at her new mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;you-all ain&rsquo;t puttin&rsquo; me inta dis year
fine bedroom!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a kind of horror.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is your room,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud kindly,
stepping in and moving a chair a little farther from
the bed, that there might be room for the girl&rsquo;s trunk.
&ldquo;You can put your trunk right here, I should think;
and here is your closet,&rdquo; swinging open the closet door
and showing a plenitude of hooks and hangers, &ldquo;and
that is your bathroom.&rdquo; She pushed back the crash
curtain that shut off the tiny bathroom, and stood back
smiling. But the girl was not looking at her. She had
cast one wild look around, and then her eyes had been
riveted on the little vase on her bureau, containing a
single late rose that Leslie had found blooming in the
small garden at the rear, and put there for good luck,
she said. Could it be that any one had cared to pick a
flower for a servant&rsquo;s room? Her eyes filled with tears;
she dropped her bundles on the floor, and came over to
where her new mistress stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said in a choked voice. &ldquo;If you-all is
goin&rsquo; to treat me like comp&rsquo;ny, I&rsquo;se jest goin&rsquo; to wuk
my fingahs to de bone for youse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the advent of Cherry things began to settle
down into something like routine. The inn was abandoned
entirely, and each meal was a festive occasion.
Cherry took kindly to the cooking-lessons that Julia
Cloud knew well how to give. Light, wonderful white
bread came forth from the white-enamel gas-range
oven, sweet, rich, nutty loaves of brown bread, even
more delectable. Waffles and muffins and pancakes
vied with one another to make one meal better
than another; apple dumpling, cherry pie, and
blackberry roly-poly varied with chocolate steamed pudding,
lemon custard, and velvet whip made the desserts
an eagerly awaited surprise.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></div>
<p>Leslie hovered over everything new that was made,
and wanted to have a hand in it. Each day she learned
some new and wholesome fact about housekeeping, and
seemed to take to the knowledge readily. Her first
attempt at real cooking was learning to make bread;
and, when she succeeded so well that Allison thought
it was his aunt&rsquo;s baking, she declared her intention of
making it once a week just to keep her hand in.</p>
<p>Allison had said no more about Christian Endeavor;
and, when Thursday afternoon came, he asked
his aunt to ride to the city after a few little articles that
were still needed to make the house complete. They
had a pleasant trip, and Julia Cloud entirely forgot
that the young people had been asked to attend the
committee meeting that evening. Perhaps Allison was
waiting for her to speak about it; for he looked at his
watch uneasily several times, and glanced back at his
aunt suspiciously; but she sat serenely enjoying the
ride, and said nothing. At last, just as they were
nearing home he burst forth with, &ldquo;Cloudy, do you
really think we ought to go to that bl-looming
thing to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud lifted quiet eyes and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you ought to go; did I, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, you sorta did, Cloudy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I did. I said it wasn&rsquo;t a matter
for me to meddle with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Allison, not unless you feel that God has
called you and you are willing to do what He wants
you to. If you just went because you thought I wanted
you to go, I don&rsquo;t believe it would be worth while, because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
you wouldn&rsquo;t be working with the right spirit.
But, as I said before, that is something you have
got to account for to God, not to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison drew his brows in a frown, and said no
more; but he was almost silent at supper, and ate with
an abstracted air. At quarter to eight he flung down
the magazine he had been reading, and got up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;ve got to go to that bloomin&rsquo;
thing,&rdquo; he said half angrily. &ldquo;Come on, kid;
you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie hurried into her hat and cape, and they
went off together, Allison grumbling in a low, half-pleasant
voice all the time. Julia Cloud sat apparently
reading, watching the little byplay, and praying that
God would strengthen the young heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Moses!&rdquo; she murmured with a smile on her
lips as the front door banged behind the children and
she was left reading alone.</p>
<p>Two hours later the two returned full of enthusiasm.
Leslie was brimming over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Cloudy, we&rsquo;re going to give this sleepy old town
the surprise of a lifetime! We&rsquo;re going to have a grand
time to-morrow night, just getting all the members
together and doping it out what to do. And you ought
to hear Allison talk! He&rsquo;s just like a man! He made
a wonderful speech telling them how they ought to
get together, and everybody do teamwork and all that,
like they do in football; and they asked him to make it
over again to-morrow night, and he&rsquo;s going to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie&rsquo;s eyes were shining with pride, and she
looked at her brother lovingly. He flushed
embarrassedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what could you do, Cloudy? There they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
were sitting like a lot of boobs, and nobody knowing
what to do except that Jane Bristol. She&rsquo;s the only
sensible one of the bunch, and they don&rsquo;t listen to her.
They made me mad, ignoring her suggestions the way
they did; so I had to speak up and say she was right;
and I guess I talked a lot more when I got started,
because she really had the right dope, all right, and they
ought to have had sense enough to know it. She&rsquo;s been
in this work before, and been to big State conventions
and things. Say, Cloudy, that Christian Endeavor
stuff must be a pretty big thing. It seems to have members
all over the world, and it&rsquo;s really a kind of international
fraternity. I rather like their line. It&rsquo;s stiff
all right, but that&rsquo;s the only way if you&rsquo;re going into
a thing like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did the praying go?&rdquo; asked Julia Cloud,
watching her boy&rsquo;s handsome, eager face as he talked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he evaded reticently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> prayed, Cloudy!&rdquo; announced Leslie proudly.
&ldquo;It was <i>regular</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what could a fellow do?&rdquo; said Allison
apologetically, as if he had done something he was half
ashamed of. &ldquo;That poor girl prayed something wonderful,
and then they all sat and sat like a parcel of
boobs until you could feel her cheeks getting red, and
nobody opening their mouths; so I started in. I didn&rsquo;t
know what to say, but I thought somebody ought to
say something. I did the best I knew how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was regular, Cloudy!&rdquo; repeated Leslie with
shining eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it got &rsquo;em started, anyhow,&rdquo; said Allison.
&ldquo;That was all that mattered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud with lips trembling joyously into a smile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
of thanksgiving listened, and felt her heart glad. Somehow
she knew that her boy had yielded himself to the
call of his God to lead this band of young people out
of an Egypt into a promised land, and she saw as by
faith how he himself would be led to talk with God
on the mount before the great work was completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really was regular, Cloudy,&rdquo; reiterated Leslie.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know my brother could pray like that, or
talk, either. After he prayed everybody prayed, just
a sentence or two, even that little baby doll Lila that
was here the other night. They didn&rsquo;t say much, but
you could see they wanted to do the right thing and be
right in it. But everybody was in earnest; they really
were, Cloudy. That Jane Bristol is wonderful! The
president had told her she was chairman, and all about
the meeting; and she read some verses out of the Bible
about Christ&rsquo;s being always in a meeting where there
were just two or three, and about two or three agreeing
to ask for something and always getting it. I never
knew there were such verses in the Bible, did you?
Well, and after that it seemed awfully solemn, just
as if we had all come into God&rsquo;s reception-room and
were waiting to ask Him as a big favor to help this
little Christian Endeavor Society to be worth something
in His kingdom. Those aren&rsquo;t my words, Cloudy;
you needn&rsquo;t look surprised. That&rsquo;s the way Jane
Bristol put it, and it made me feel queer all down
my back when she said it, as it did the first time I went
to hear some great music. And&ndash;&ndash;why, after that you
couldn&rsquo;t help praying just a little, so the promise would
hold good. It wasn&rsquo;t square not to help them out,
you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re not going to have anybody to-morrow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
night but the regular members until we get them all
to understand and be ready to help,&rdquo; went on Allison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they asked Allison to take charge and help
plan it all out; and Allison is going to hunt up some
of the big Christian Endeavor people in the city, and
get them to come out one or two at a time to our
meetings,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Julia Cloud noted the pronoun &ldquo;our&rdquo;
with satisfaction,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and stir things up on Sundays;
and we&rsquo;ll drive in and get them, and bring them to our
house to supper, maybe, and put them wise to things
so they&rsquo;ll know best how to help; and then we&rsquo;ll drive
them home after church that night, see? And Allison
suggested that we have pretty soon a series of parties
or receptions, just for the young people to get together
and bring new ones in one at a time, just as the boys
in college have rushing-parties, you know. We&rsquo;ll have
a reception, real formal, with regular eats from a
caterer, and flowers and invitations and everything, for
the first one; and a Hallowe&rsquo;en party for the October
meeting, and a banquet for the November meeting, just
about Thanksgiving time, you know. Oh, it&rsquo;s going
to be lots of fun. And, Cloudy, I told them we&rsquo;d make
a hundred sandwiches for to-morrow night; you don&rsquo;t
mind, do you? We can buy the bread, and it won&rsquo;t
take long to make them. I know how to cut them in
pretty shapes, and I thought I&rsquo;d tie them with ribbons
to match the lemonade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud with radiant face entered into the plans
eagerly, and to have heard them talk one would never
have imagined that twenty-four hours before these two
young people had been exceedingly averse to having
anything to do with that little dying Christian Endeavor
Young People&rsquo;s Society.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And, Cloudy, that Jane Bristol is real pretty.
She had on a charming collar to-night, and her hair
fixed all soft around her face. She has beautiful hair!
I think they were all surprised at the easy way she
talked; I don&rsquo;t believe she is a day older than I am,
either. And she <i>is</i> going to college. I&rsquo;m awfully glad,
for I want to get to know her. We&rsquo;ll invite her down
here sometimes, won&rsquo;t we? I want you to know her,
Cloudy. You&rsquo;ll like her, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Julia Cloud went to her pretty gray bed that
night, and lay marvelling at the goodness of God to
answer her prayers. As for the children, they could
hardly settle down to sleep, so full of plans were they
for the revivifying of that Christian Endeavor Society.
They kept calling back and forth from room to room,
and after everything had been quiet for a long time
and Julia Cloud was just dropping off to sleep, Leslie
woke them all up calling to know if it wouldn&rsquo;t be
a good plan to have the Hallowe&rsquo;en party there at the
house and have everybody come in costume. Then
they had to begin all over again, and decide what they
would wear and who they would be. Allison declared
he was going to be a firecracker; he had a &ldquo;dandy&rdquo;
costume for it in California, and he would write to-morrow
morning to the housekeeper to look it up.</p>
<p>Leslie wanted to have a candy-pull, with apples and
nuts and raisins for refreshments. Julia Cloud began
to wonder whether it was just as acceptable to God
to have play mixed up with the religion as these children
were doing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must look out that your festivities don&rsquo;t get
ahead of your righteousness,&rdquo; she warned half laughingly;
but Allison took her in earnest.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right there, Cloudy. That&rsquo;s one of the
things we have to look out for in frats. We have to
see we don&rsquo;t have too many social things. If we do,
the marks suffer; and right away we lose ground.
We&rsquo;ll have to keep those Sunday meetings up to the
mark&ndash;&ndash;see, kid?&ndash;&ndash;or the other things will only bring
in a lot of dead-wood that won&rsquo;t count. They must
come to the Sunday meetings, or they don&rsquo;t get invited
to the parties. That&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;ll fix &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use saying &lsquo;must,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Leslie wisely.
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have your meetings interesting, they
won&rsquo;t come anyhow you fix it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a girl for you!&rdquo; scorned Allison. &ldquo;No
loyalty in the whole bunch. They&rsquo;ve got to <i>like</i> everything.
Now, the real spirit is to come and <i>make</i> the
meetings good, just because they&rsquo;re <i>your</i> meetings.
See, kid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see,&rdquo; snapped Leslie; &ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t come
to your old meetings at all if you are going to talk
that way about girls. I guess I&rsquo;ve always been loyal to
everything, especially you, and I won&rsquo;t stand for that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean you, kid; I was talking about
girls in general,&rdquo; soothed the brother. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all
right, of course. But those little fluffy-ruffles that sat
in the back seat, now, you&rsquo;ll have to teach them what
loyalty means. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally the household settled to sleep.</p>
<p>The next day the little house saw little else done
save the making of marvellous dainty sandwiches in
various forms and shapes.</p>
<p>Even Cherry entered into the work with zest, and
Julia Cloud proved herself rich in suggestion for different
fillings, till great platters of the finished product
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
reposed in the big white refrigerator, neatly tucked
about with damp napkins to keep them from drying.</p>
<p>All that day Allison flew hither and yon in his car,
carrying some member of the committee on errands
connected with the evening social. Never had such a
stir been made about a mere church social in all the
annals of the society. Every remotest member was
hunted out and persuaded to be present, and Allison
agreed to go around in the evening and pick up at least
a dozen who had professed their inability to get there
alone. So the big blue car was enlisted in Christian
Endeavor service, and the young people were as busy
and as happy as ever they had been in getting their
little new home settled. They drove away about seven
o&rsquo;clock after a hasty supper, with their platters of
sandwiches safely guarded on the back seat; and Julia
Cloud watched them, and smiled and was glad. She
wondered whether this work would get such a hold
upon them that it would last after they started their
college work, and fervently hoped that it might, so that
there would be another link to bind them to God&rsquo;s
house and His work. She sighed to think how many
things there would likely be to draw them away.</p>
<p>About ten o&rsquo;clock Leslie telephoned. She wanted
to bring Jane Bristol home for the night, as the people
where Jane was living were away, and she would
otherwise have to stay alone in a big house. Julia
Cloud readily assented, and she and Cherry had a pleasant
half-hour putting one of the guest-rooms in order.
It was while she was doing this that she began to wonder
seriously what Jane Bristol would be like. Who
was brought intimately into their new home might mean
so much to her two children. And in this room, too,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
after Cherry had gone to bed, she knelt and breathed
a consecrating prayer. Then she went down-stairs
to wait for the coming of her children, building up the
fire and lighting the porch light so that all would be
cheery and attractive for them and their guest. Only
a little, lonesome child who did housework for her living,
but it was good to be able to give her a pleasant
welcome.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the car arrived, and the two girls
came chattering in, while Allison put the car away.
At least, Leslie was chattering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you look so lovely in that soft blue dress!&rdquo;
she was saying. &ldquo;It is so graceful, and the color just
fits your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only some old accordion-pleated chiffon I
had,&rdquo; answered the guest half ashamed. &ldquo;I had to
wash it and dye it and make it myself, and I wasn&rsquo;t
sure the pleats would iron out, or that it would do at
all. You know I don&rsquo;t have much use for evening
dresses, and I really couldn&rsquo;t afford to get one. That&rsquo;s
the reason I hesitated at your suggestion about having
receptions and parties. But I guess you have to
have them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you made it all yourself!
Why you&rsquo;re a wonder! Isn&rsquo;t she, Cloudy? Just take
her in and look for yourself! She made that dress
all herself out of old things that she washed and
dyed. Why, it looks like an imported frock. Doesn&rsquo;t
it look like one, Cloudy? And that girdle is darling,
all shirred that way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was Julia Cloud&rsquo;s introduction to the guest
as she stood in the open door and watched the two trip
along the brick terrace to the entrance.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></div>
<p>Leslie snatched away the long, dark cloak that
covered Jane Bristol&rsquo;s dress; and she stood forth embarrassed
in the firelight, clad in soft, pale-blue chiffon
in simple straight lines blending into the white throat
in a little round neck, and draping the white girlish,
arms. The firelight and lamplight glimmered and
flickered over the softly waved brown hair, the sweet,
serious brow, the delicate, refined face; and Jane Bristol
lifted two earnest deep-blue eyes, and looked at Julia
Cloud. Then between them flashed a look of understanding
and sympathy, and each knew at once that she
liked the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a dear, Cloudy Jewel?&rdquo; demanded
Leslie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is!&rdquo; responded Julia Cloud, and put her arms
softly around the slender blue-clad shoulders. Then
she looked up to see the eyes of Allison resting upon
them with satisfaction.</p>
<p>They turned down the light and sat before the fire
for a little while, telling about the success of the evening
and talking of this and that, just getting acquainted;
and, when they finally took Jane Bristol up to the pretty
guest-room, it was with a sense that a new and lasting
friendship had been well begun. Julia Cloud as she
lay down to sleep found herself wondering whether
her children would always show so much good sense in
picking out their friends as they had done this time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>
<p>The day when college opened was a great day.
The children could hardly eat any breakfast,
and Allison gave Leslie a great many edifying
instructions about registering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, kid, if you get stuck for anything, just you
hunt me up. I&rsquo;ll see that you get straightened out.
If you and Jane Bristol could only get together, you
could help each other a lot. I&rsquo;ll get some dope from
some of the last-year fellows. That&rsquo;s the advantage
I get from finding a chapter of my frat here. They&rsquo;ll
put me wise as to the best course-advisers, and you
stick around near the entrance till I give you the right
dope. It doesn&rsquo;t pay to get started wrong in college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie meekly accepted all these admonitions, and
they started off together in the car with an abstracted
wave of good-by to Julia Cloud, who somehow felt
suddenly left out of the universe. To have her two
newly-acquired children suddenly withdrawn by the
power of a great educational institution and swept
beyond her horizon was disconcerting. She had not
imagined she would feel this way. She stood in the
window watching them, and wiped away a furtive tear,
and then laughed to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old fool!&rdquo; she said softly to the window-pane.
&ldquo;The trouble with you is, you&rsquo;d like to be going to college
yourself, and you know it! Now put this out of
your mind, and go to work planning how to make home
doubly attractive when they get back, so that they will
want to spend every minute possible here instead of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
being drawn away from it. They love it. Now keep
them loving it. That&rsquo;s your job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the two came back at noon, they were radiant
and enthusiastic as usual, albeit they had many a growl
to express. One would have thought to hear Allison
that he had been running colleges for some fifty years
the way he criticized the policy and told how things
ought to be run. At first Julia Cloud was greatly distressed
by it all, thinking that they surely had made
a mistake in their selection of a college, but it gradually
dawned upon her that this was a sort of superior
attitude maintained by upper-class men toward all institutions
of learning, particularly those in which they
happened to be studying, that it was really only an
indication of growing developing minds keen to see
mistakes and trying to think out remedies, and as yet
inexperienced enough to think they could remedy the
whole sick world.</p>
<p>The opening days of college were turbulent days for
Julia Cloud. Her children were so excited they could
neither eat nor sleep. They were liable to turn up
unexpectedly at almost any hour of the morning or
afternoon, hungry as bears, and always in a hurry.
They had so many new things to tell her about, and
no time in which to talk. They mixed things terribly,
and gave her impressions that took months to right;
and they could not understand why she looked distressed
at their flightiness. They were both taken up
eagerly by the students and invited hither and yon
by the various groups and societies, which frequently
caused them to be absent from meals while they were
being dined and lunched and breakfasted. Of course,
Julia Cloud reflected, two such good-looking, well-dressed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
easy-mannered young people, with a home in
the town where they could invite people, a car in which
to take friends out, and a free hand with money, would
be popular anywhere. Her anxiety grew as the first
week waxed toward its end and finished up Saturday
night with invitations to two dances and one week-end
party at a country house ten miles away.</p>
<p>Leslie rushed in breathless about six o&rsquo;clock Saturday
evening, and declared she was too much in a hurry
to eat anything; she must get dressed at once, and put
some things in her bag. She rattled on about the different
social functions she was expected to attend that
evening until Julia Cloud was in hopeless confusion,
and could only stand and listen, and try to find the
things that Leslie in her hurry had overlooked. Then
Allison arrived, and wanted some supper. He talked
with his mouth full about where he was going and
what he was going to do, and at the end of an hour
and a half Julia Cloud had a very indefinite idea of
anything. She had a swift mental vision of church and
Sabbath and Christian Endeavor all slipping slowly out
of their calculation, and the <span class='smcap'>world</span> in large letters taking
the forefront of their vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to a dance!&rdquo; she said in a white,
stricken way she had when an anxiety first bewildered
her. &ldquo;To <i>two</i> dances! O my dear Leslie! You&ndash;&ndash;<i>dance</i>,
then? I&ndash;&ndash;hadn&rsquo;t thought of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I dance!&rdquo; said Leslie gayly, drawing up the
delicate silk stocking over her slim ankles and slipping
on a silver slipper. &ldquo;You ought to see me. And
Allison can dance, too. We&rsquo;ll show you sometime.
Don&rsquo;t you like dancing, Cloudy? Why, Cloudy! You
couldn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t approve of dancing? Not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
<i>really</i>! But where would we be? <i>Everybody</i> dances!
Why, there wouldn&rsquo;t be anything else to do when young
people went out. Oh, do you suppose Cherry would
press out this skirt a little bit? It&rsquo;s got horribly
mussed in that drawer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud had dropped into a chair with an all-gone
feeling and a lightness in the top of her head.
She felt as if the world, the flesh, and the devil had
suddenly dropped down upon the house and were carrying
off her children bodily, and she was powerless to
prevent it. She could not keep the pain of it out of
her eyes; yet she did not know what to say in this
emergency. None of the things that had always seemed
entirely convincing in forming her own opinions seemed
adequate to the occasion. Leslie turned suddenly, and
saw her stricken face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Cloudy? Is something wrong?
Aren&rsquo;t you well? Don&rsquo;t you like me to go to a dance?
Why, Cloudy! Do you really <i>object</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no right to object, I suppose, dear,&rdquo; she
said, trying to speak calmly; &ldquo;but&ndash;&ndash;Leslie, I can&rsquo;t bear
to think of you dancing; it&rsquo;s not nice. It&rsquo;s too&ndash;&ndash;too
intimate! My little flower of a girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but we have to dance, Cloudy; that&rsquo;s ridiculous!
And you aren&rsquo;t used to dances, or you wouldn&rsquo;t
say so. Can&rsquo;t you trust me to be perfectly nice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud shuddered, and went to the head of the
stairs to answer a question Allison was calling up to
her; and, when, she came back, she said no more about
it. The pain was too great, and she felt too bewildered
for argument. Leslie was enveloped in rose-colored
tulle, with touches of silver, and looked like a young
goddess with straps of silver over her slim shoulders
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
and a thread of pearls about her throat. The white
neck and back that the wisp of rose-color made no
attempt to conceal were very beautiful and quite childish,
but they shocked the sweet soul of Julia Cloud
inexpressibly. She stood aghast when Leslie whirled
upon her and demanded to know how she liked
the gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O my dear!&rdquo; gasped her aunt. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going
out before people&ndash;&ndash;<i>men</i>&ndash;&ndash;all undressed like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie gave her one glance of hurt dismay, whirled
back to her glass, and examined herself critically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Cloudy!&rdquo; Her voice was almost trembling,
and her cheeks were rosier than the tulle with disappointment.
&ldquo;Why, Cloudy, I thought it was lovely!
It&rsquo;s just like everybody&rsquo;s else. I thought you would
think I looked <i>nice</i>!&rdquo; The child drooped, and Julia
Cloud went up to her gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is beautiful, darling, and you are&ndash;&ndash;exquisite!
But, dear! It seems terrible for my little girl to go
among young men so sort of nakedly. I&rsquo;m sure if you
understood life better, you wouldn&rsquo;t do it. You are
tempting men to wrong thoughts, undressed that way,
and you are putting on common view the intimate loveliness
of the body God gave you to keep holy and
pure. It is the way cheap women have of making
many men love them in a careless, physical way. I
don&rsquo;t know how to tell you, but it seems terrible to me.
If you were my own little girl, I never, <i>never</i> would be
willing to have you go out that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said enough!&rdquo; almost screamed Leslie
with a sudden frenzy of rage, shame, and disappointment.
&ldquo;I feel as if I never could look anybody in the
face again!&rdquo; And with a cry she flung herself into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
the jumble of bright garments on her bed, and wept as
if her heart would break. Julia Cloud stood over her
in consternation, and tried to soothe her; but nothing
did any good. The young storm had to have its
way, and the slim pink shoulders shook in convulsive
sobs, while the dismayed elder sat down beside
the bed, with troubled eyes upon her, and waited,
praying quietly.</p>
<p>In the midst of it all Allison appeared at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in thunder is the matter? I&rsquo;ve yelled my
head off, and nobody answers. What is the matter
with you, kid? It&rsquo;s time we started, and you doing
the baby act! I never thought you&rsquo;d get hystericky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie lifted a wet and smeary face out of her
pillow and addressed her brother defiantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve good reason to cry!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Cloudy
thinks I&rsquo;m not decent to go out in this dress, and
she won&rsquo;t believe everybody dresses this way; and I&rsquo;m
<i>not going</i>! I&rsquo;m <i>never</i> going <i>anywhere</i> again; I&rsquo;m <i>disgraced</i>!&rdquo;
And down went her head in the pillow again
with another long, convulsive sob.</p>
<p>Her brother strode over to her, and lifted her up
firmly but gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, kid, quit your crying and be sensible.
Stand up and let&rsquo;s look at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood her upon her feet; and she swayed there,
quivering, half ashamed, her hands to her tear-stained
face, her pink shoulders heaving and her soft, pink chest
quivering with sobs, while he surveyed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, kid, I must say I agree with Cloudy,&rdquo; he
said half reluctantly at last. &ldquo;The dress is a peach,
of course, and you look like an angel in it; but, if you
could hear the rotten things the fellows say about the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
way the girls dress, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to go that way;
and I don&rsquo;t want them to talk that way about my sister.
Couldn&rsquo;t you stick in a towel or an apron or something,
and make a little more waist to the thing? I&rsquo;m sure
you&rsquo;d look just as pretty, and the fellows would think
you a whole lot nicer girl. I don&rsquo;t want you to get the
nickname of the Freshman Vamp. I couldn&rsquo;t stand
for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Leslie sank into a chair, and covered her face
for another cry, declaring it was no use, it would
utterly spoil the dress to do anything to it, and she
couldn&rsquo;t go, and wouldn&rsquo;t go and wear it; but at last
Julia Cloud came to the rescue with needle and thread
and soft rose drapery made from a scarf of Leslie&rsquo;s that
exactly matched the dress; and presently she stood meek
and sweet, and quite modest, blooming prettily out of
her pink, misty garments like an opening apple-blossom
in spite of her recent tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when are you coming back?&rdquo; asked Julia
Cloud in sudden dismay, her troubles returning in full
force as she watched them going out the door to the car,
Allison carrying two bags and telling Leslie to hurry
for all she was worth.</p>
<p>The two children turned then, and faced their aunt,
with a swift, comprehending vision of what this expedition
of theirs meant to her. It had not occurred to
them before that they were deliberately planning to
spend most of the night, Saturday night, in mirth, and
stay over Sunday at a house-party where the Sabbath
would be as a thing unknown. Nobody had ever talked
to them about these things before. They had accepted
it as a part of the world of society into which they had
been born, and they had never questioned it. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
were impatient now that their tried and true friend
and comrade did not comprehend that this occasion was
different from most, and that it must be an exception.
They were willing to keep the Sabbath in general, but
in this particular they felt they must not be hampered.
The whole idea shone plainly in their faces, and the
pain and disappointment and chagrin shone clearly,
emphatically in Julia Cloud&rsquo;s eyes as she faced them
and read the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we don&rsquo;t know, just for sure, Cloudy,&rdquo;
Allison tried to temporize. &ldquo;You see, they usually
dance to all hours. It&rsquo;s Saturday night, and no classes
to-morrow, and this is an unusual occasion. It&rsquo;s a
week-end party, you know&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&ndash;&ndash;you won&rsquo;t be back to-night! You are not
going to church to-morrow! You will spend the Sabbath
at a party!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said these things as if she were telling them
to herself so that she could better take in the facts
and not cry out with the disappointment of it. There
was no quality of fault-finding in her tone, but the pain
of her voice cut to the heart the two young culprits.
Therefore, according to the code of loving human
nature, they got angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course!&rdquo; chirped Leslie. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you
expect that? That&rsquo;s what week-end parties are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, cut this out, Leslie,&rdquo; cried Allison. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
gotta beat it. We&rsquo;re way late now! Cloudy, you can
expect us when we get here. Don&rsquo;t bother about anything.
There&rsquo;s no need to. We&rsquo;ll telephone you later
when we expect to come back. Nightie, nightie,
Cloudy. You go rest yourself. You look tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave her a hurried, deprecatory kiss, and swept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
his sister out into the night. Julia Cloud heard the
purring of the engine, saw the lights of the car glide
away from the door down the street and out of sight.
They were gone! She felt as though a piece of herself
had been torn away from her and flung out for the
world to trample upon. For a long time she stood
staring from the window into the darkness, unshed
tears burning behind her eyes and throat, trying to
steady the beating of her heart and get used to the
gnawing trouble that somehow made her feel faint
and weak.</p>
<p>It came over her that she had been a fool to
attempt to fill the place of mother to these two modern
young things. Their own ideas were fully made up
about all questions that seemed vital to her. She had
been a fossil in a back-country place all her life, and of
course they felt she did not know. Well, of course she
did not know much about modern society and its ways,
save to dread it, and to doubt it, and to wish to keep
them away from it. She was prejudiced, perhaps.
Yes, she had been reared that way, and the world
would call her narrow. Would Christ the Lord feel
that way about it? Did He like to have His children
dressing like abandoned women and making free with
one another under the guise of polite social customs?
Did He want His children to spend their Sabbaths in
play, however innocent the play might be? She turned
with a sigh away from the window. No, she could not
see it any other way. It was the way of the world,
and that was all there was to it. Leslie had made it
plain when she said they had to do it or be left out.
And wasn&rsquo;t that just what it meant to be a &ldquo;peculiar
people&rdquo; unto the Lord, to be willing to give up doubtful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
things that harmed people for the sake of keeping pure
and unspotted from the world? &ldquo;If ye were of the
world, the world would love its own; but because I
have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world
hateth you,&rdquo; came the familiar old words. Well, and
what should she do now? It wouldn&rsquo;t do to rave and
fuss about things. That never did any good. She
couldn&rsquo;t say she wouldn&rsquo;t stay if they danced and went
away over the Sabbath. Those were things in which
she might advise, but had no authority. They were old
enough to decide such matters for themselves. She
could only use her influence, and trust the rest with
the Lord. Yes, there was one thing she could do. She
could pray!</p>
<p>So Julia Cloud gave her quiet orders to Cherry,
and went up to her rose-and-gray room to kneel by the
bed and pray, agonizing for her beloved children
through the long hours of that long, long evening.</p>
<p>It was a quiet face that she lifted at last from her
vigil, for it bore the brightness of a face-to-face communion
with her Lord; and she rose and went about her
preparations for the night. Then, just as she had
taken down her hair and was brushing it in a silver
cloud about her shoulders, she heard a car drive up. A
moment more a key turned in the latch, and some one
came in.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud stood with the hair-brush poised half-way
down a strand of hair, and listened. Yes, the
car had gone on to the garage. What could
have happened?</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>
<p>It was all still below stairs, then a soft, stealthy
silken movement, cautiously coming up the stairs.
Julia Cloud went quickly to the hall door, and
switched on the light. On the landing stood Leslie,
lovely and flushed, with her hair slightly ruffled and
her velvet evening cloak thrown back, showing the rosy
mist of her dress. She stood with one silver slipper
poised on the stairs, a sweet, guilty look on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Cloudy! I thought you were asleep, and I
didn&rsquo;t want to waken you,&rdquo; she said, penitently; &ldquo;but
you haven&rsquo;t gone to bed yet, have you? I&rsquo;m glad. We
wanted you to know we were home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is anything the matter?&rdquo; Julia Cloud asked with
a stricture of emotion in her throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; only we got tired, and we didn&rsquo;t want to
stay to their old party, anyway, and we&rsquo;d rather be
home.&rdquo; Leslie sprang up the stairs, and caught her
aunt in her arms with one of her sweet, violent kisses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O my dear!&rdquo; was all Julia Cloud could say.
And then they heard Allison closing the door softly
below, and creaking across the floor and up the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you waked her up!&rdquo; he said reproachfully
as he caught sight of his sister in Julia Cloud&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re wrong. She hadn&rsquo;t even gone to bed
yet. I knew she wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Leslie, nestling closer.
&ldquo;Say, Cloudy, we&rsquo;re not going to trouble you that way
again. It isn&rsquo;t worth it. We don&rsquo;t like their old
dancing, anyway. I couldn&rsquo;t forget the way you looked
so hurt&ndash;&ndash;and the things you said. Won&rsquo;t you please
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
come down to the fire awhile? We want to tell you
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down on the couch, with Allison stirring up the
dying embers and Leslie nestled close to her, Julia Cloud
heard bits about the evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t bad, Cloudy, &rsquo;deed it wasn&rsquo;t. They
dance a lot nicer in colleges than they do other places.
I know, for I&rsquo;ve been to lots of dances, and I never let
men get too familiar. Allison taught me that when
I was little. That&rsquo;s why what you said made me so
mad. I&rsquo;ve always been a lot carefuller than you&rsquo;d
think, and I never dance with anybody the second time
if I don&rsquo;t like the way he does it the first time. And
everybody was real nice and dignified to-night, Cloudy.
The boys are all shy and bashful, anyway; only I
couldn&rsquo;t forget what you had said about not liking to
have me do it; and it made everything seem so&ndash;&ndash;so&ndash;&ndash;well,
not nice; and I just felt uncomfortable; and one
dance I sent the boy for a glass of water for me, and I
just sat it out; and, when Allison saw me, he came
over, and said, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s beat it!&rsquo; and so I slipped up to
the dressing-room, and got my cloak, and we just ran
away without telling anybody. Wasn&rsquo;t that perfectly
dreadful? But I&rsquo;ll call the girl up after a while, and
tell her we had to come home and we didn&rsquo;t want to
spoil their fun telling them so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat for an hour talking before the fire, the
young people telling her all about their experiences of
the last few days, and letting her into their lives again
with the old sweet relation. Then they drifted back
again to the subject of dancing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a whoop whether I dance or not,
Cloudy,&rdquo; said Allison. &ldquo;I never did care much about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
it, and I don&rsquo;t see having my sister dance with some
fellows, either. Only it does cut you out of lots of
fun, and you get in bad with everybody if you don&rsquo;t
do it. I expected we&rsquo;d have to have dances here at the
house, too, sometimes; but, if you don&rsquo;t like it, we
won&rsquo;t; and that&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dear, that&rsquo;s beautiful of you. Of course I
couldn&rsquo;t allow you to let me upset your life and spoil
all your pleasure; but I&rsquo;m wondering if we couldn&rsquo;t
try an experiment. It seems to me there ought to
be things that people would enjoy as much as dancing,
and why couldn&rsquo;t we find enough of them to fill up the
evenings and make them forget about the dancing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be some that won&rsquo;t come, of course,&rdquo; said
Leslie; &ldquo;but we should worry! They won&rsquo;t be the kind
we&rsquo;ll like, anyway. Jane Bristol doesn&rsquo;t dance. She
told me so yesterday. She said her mother never did,
and brought her up to feel that she didn&rsquo;t want
to, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s some girl,&rdquo; said Allison irrelevantly. &ldquo;She
entered the sophomore class with credits she got for
studying in the summer school and some night-work.
Did you know that, kid? I was in the office when she
came in for her card, and I heard the profs talking
about her and saying she had some bean. Those
chumps in the village will find out some day that the
girl they despised is worth more than the whole lot
of them put together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud leaned forward, and touched lightly and
affectionately the hair that waved back from the boy&rsquo;s
forehead, and spoke tenderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear boy, I&rsquo;ll not forget your leaving your friends
and coming back to me and to the Sabbath and church
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
and all that. It means a lot to me to have my children
observe those things. I hope some day you&rsquo;ll do it
because you feel you want to please God instead of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Allison, trying not to look embarrassed.
&ldquo;I guess maybe I care about that, too, a
little bit. To tell the truth, Cloudy, I couldn&rsquo;t see staying
away from that Christian Endeavor meeting after
I&rsquo;ve worked hard all the week to get people to come to
it. It didn&rsquo;t seem square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moment was tense with deep feeling, and Julia
Cloud could not bring herself to break it by words.
She brought the boy&rsquo;s hand up to her lips, and pressed
it close; and then just as she was about to speak the
telephone rang sharply again and again.</p>
<p>Allison sprang up, and went to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello. Yes. Oh! Miss Bristol! What? Are
you sure? I&rsquo;ll be there at once. Lock yourself in your
room till I get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hung up the receiver excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call up the fire department quick, Leslie! Tell
them to hurry. There&rsquo;s some one breaking into the
Johnson house, and Jane Bristol is there alone with the
children. It&rsquo;s Park Avenue, you know. Hustle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was out the door before they could exclaim,
and Leslie hastened to the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went without his overcoat,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud,
hurrying to the closet for it. &ldquo;It will be very cold
riding. He ought to have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie hung up the receiver, and flung her velvet
cloak about her hurriedly, grabbing the overcoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to me, Cloudy; I&rsquo;m going with him!&rdquo; she
cried, and dashed out the door as the car slid out
of the garage.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;O Leslie! Child! You <i>oughtn&rsquo;t</i> to go!&rdquo; she
cried, rushing to the door; but Leslie was already climbing
into the car, moving as it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Cloudy!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a revolver in the car, you know!&rdquo; and the car whirled
away down the street.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud stood gasping after them; the horrible
thought of a revolver in the car did not cheer her as
Leslie had evidently hoped it would. What children
they were, after all, plunging her from one trouble
into another, yet what dear, tender-hearted, loving
children! She went in, and found a heavy cloak, and
went out again to listen. Then it came to her that
perhaps Leslie had not made the operator understand;
so she went back to the telephone to try to find out
whether any one had been sent. Suppose those children
should try to face a burglar alone! There might be
more than one for aught they knew. Oh, Leslie <i>should
not</i> have gone! A terrible anxiety took possession
of her, and she tried to pray as she worked the telephone
hook up and down and waited for the operator. Then
into the quiet of the night there came the loud clang
of the fire-bell, and a moment later hurried calls and
voices in the distance, sounding through the front door
that Julia Cloud had left open. For an instant she was
relieved, and then she reflected that this might be a fire
somewhere else, and not the call for the Johnson house
at all; so she kept on trying to call the operator. At
last a snappy voice snarled into her ear. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
tell where the fire is; we&rsquo;re not allowed any more,&rdquo; and
snap! The operator was gone again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to know where the fire is!&rdquo;
called Julia Cloud in dismay. &ldquo;I want to ask
a question.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></div>
<p>No answer came, and the dim buzz of the wire
sounded emptily back to her anxious ear. At last she
gave it up, and went out to the street to look up and
down. If she only knew which way was Park Avenue!
She could hear the engine now, clattering along with
the hook and ladder behind; and dark, hurrying forms
crossed the street just beyond the next corner, but no
one came by. She hurried out to the corner, and
called to a boy who was passing; and he yelled out:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, lady. Up Park Avenue somewhere.&rdquo;
Then the street grew very quiet again, and all the noise
centred away in the distance. A shot rang out, and
voices shouted, and her heart beat so loud she could
hear it. She hurried back to the house again, and tried
to get the telephone operator; but nothing came of it,
and for the next twenty minutes she vibrated between
the street and the telephone, and wondered whether she
ought not to wake up Cherry and do something else.</p>
<p>It seemed perfectly terrible to think of those two
children handling a burglar alone&ndash;&ndash;and yet what could
she do?</p>
<p>Pretty soon, however, she heard the fire-engine
returning, with the crowd, and she hurried down to
the corner to find out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t no fire at all, lady,&rdquo; answered a boy
whom she questioned. &ldquo;It was just two men breakin&rsquo;
into a house, but they ketched &rsquo;em both an&rsquo; are takin&rsquo;
&rsquo;em down to the lockup. No, lady, there wasn&rsquo;t nobody
killed. There was some shootin&rsquo;, sure! A girl done it!
Some college girl in a car. She see the guy comin&rsquo; to
make a get-away in her car, see? And she let go at
him, and picked him off the first call, got him through
the knee; an&rsquo; by that time the fire comp&rsquo;ny got there,
and cinched &rsquo;em both. She&rsquo;s some girl, she is!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></div>
<p>Julia Cloud felt her head whirling, and hurried back
to the house to sit down. She was trembling from
head to foot. Was it Leslie who had shot the burglar?
Leslie, her little pink-and-silver butterfly, who seemed
so much like a baby yet in many ways? Oh, what a
horrible danger she had escaped! If she had escaped.
Perhaps the boy did not know. Oh, if they would but
come! It seemed hours since they had left. The midnight
train was just pulling into the station! How
exasperating that the telephone did not respond!
Something must be out of order with it. Hark! Was
that the car? It surely was!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>
<p>How welcome a sound was the churn of the
engine as it came flying up the road and
turned into the driveway!</p>
<p>Julia Cloud was at the door, waiting to receive them,
straining her eyes into the darkness to be sure they
were both there.</p>
<p>Leslie sprang out, and dashed into her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Cloudy! You waited up, didn&rsquo;t you? We
thought you must be asleep and didn&rsquo;t hear the telephone.
We tried to call you up and explain. You
see, Jane was there alone, and of course she didn&rsquo;t
much enjoy staying after what had happened; so we
waited till the Johnsons got back from the city. They
had been to the theatre, and they just came on that
midnight train. If I lived in a lonely place like that,
I wouldn&rsquo;t leave three babies with a young girl all alone
in the house. It seems the servants were all away, or
left, or something. I guess they were pretty scared
when they got back. I wanted to bring the children up
here to stay all night with us, and let them <i>be</i> scared
when they got home; but she wouldn&rsquo;t, of course; so
we stayed with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie tossed aside her velvet cloak as she talked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was awfully exciting, Cloudy. I&rsquo;m glad I
went. There&rsquo;s no telling what might have happened
to Allison if somebody hadn&rsquo;t been there. You see
he shut down the motor as we came up to the house.
We&rsquo;d been going like a streak of lightning all the way,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
and we tried to sneak up so they wouldn&rsquo;t hear us and
get away; but there was one man outside on the watch,
and he gave the word; and just as Allison got out of the
car he disappeared into the shadows. The other one
came piling out of a window, and streaked it across
the porch and down the lawn. Allison made for him;
but he changed his course, and came straight toward
the car. I guess they thought it was empty. And
then the other one came flying out from behind the
bushes, and made for Allison; so I just leaned out of
the car and shot. I don&rsquo;t know how I ever had the
nerve, for I was terribly frightened; but he would
have got Allison in another minute, and Allison didn&rsquo;t
see him coming. He had a big club in his hand. I
saw it as he went across in front of the window, and I
knew I must do something; so I aimed right in front
of him, and I saw him go down on his knees and throw
up his hands; and then I felt sick, and began to think
what if I had killed him. I didn&rsquo;t, Cloudy; they say
I only hit his knee; but wouldn&rsquo;t it have been awful
all my life to have to think I had killed a man? I
couldn&rsquo;t have stood it, Cloudy!&rdquo; and with sudden
breaking of the tension the high-strung child flung herself
down in a little, brilliant heap at Julia Cloud&rsquo;s
knees, buried her bright face in her aunt&rsquo;s lap, and burst
into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brave little darling!&rdquo; Julia Cloud caressed
her, and folded her arms about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s all of that, Cloudy! She saved my life!&rdquo;
It was Allison who spoke, standing tall and proud above
his sister and looking down at her tenderly. &ldquo;Come
now, kiddie, don&rsquo;t give way when you&rsquo;ve been such
a trump. I knew you could shoot, but I didn&rsquo;t think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
you could keep your head like that. Cloudy, she was
a little winner, the cool way she aimed at that man
with the other one coming right toward her and meaning
plainly to get in the car and run away in it. He&rsquo;d
have taken her, too, of course, and stopped at nothing
to get away. But, when he saw the good shot she was,
and heard his pal groaning, he threw up his hands, and
turned sharp about for me. He knew it was his only
chance, and that whoever was shooting wouldn&rsquo;t shoot
at him while he was all tangled up with me; so he
made a spring at me before I knew what he was doing,
and threw me off my feet, and got a half Nelson on
me, you know&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Cloudy, he was fiendish, and I couldn&rsquo;t do a
thing, for fear of hitting Allison; and just then I heard
a motor-cycle chugging by the car. I hadn&rsquo;t heard it
before, there was so much going on; and a big, strong
fellow with his hair all standing up in the wind jumped
off, and ran toward them where they were rolling on the
ground. Then I thought of the flash-light, and turned
it on them; and that motor-cycle man saw just how
things were, and he jumped in, and grabbed the burglar;
and then all of a sudden the yard was full of men and
boys and a terrible noise and clanging, and the fire-engine
and hook and ladder came rushing up, Cloudy!
You didn&rsquo;t tell them there was a fire, did you? I
didn&rsquo;t. I told that telephone girl there was a burglar
and to send a policeman. But somehow she got it that
the house was on fire. And Jane Bristol was in the
house, with the baby in her arms and the other little
children asleep in their cribs; and she didn&rsquo;t know what
was happening because she didn&rsquo;t dare to open
the window.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></div>
<p>Into the midst of the excitement and explanations
there came a loud knock on the door, and Allison sprang
up, and went to see who was there. A young man
with dishevelled garments, hair standing on end, and
face much streaked with mud and dust stood there. A
motor-cycle leaned against the end of the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he said half shyly. &ldquo;I saw the
light, and thought some one was up yet. Did the lady
drop this? I found it in the grass when I went back
to hunt for my key-ring. It was right where she stood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held forth his hand, and there dropped from
his fingers a slender white, gleaming thing.</p>
<p>Allison flashed on the porch-light, and looked at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leslie, is this yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The motor-cycle man looked up, and there stood
the princess, her rosy garments like the mist of dawn
glowing in the light of fire and lamp, her tumbled
golden curls, her eyes bright with recent tears, her
cheeks pink with excitement. He had seen her dimly a
little while before in a long velvet cloak and a little
concealing head-scarf, standing in a motor-car shooting
with a steady hand, and again coming with swift feet
to her brother&rsquo;s side in the grass after he was released
from the burglar&rsquo;s hold; but he had not caught the
look of her face. Now he stood speechless, and stared
at the lovely apparition. Was it possible that this
lovely child had been the cool, brave girl in the car?</p>
<p>Leslie had put her hand to her throat with a quick
cry, and found it bare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My string of pearls!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How careless
of me not to have noticed they were gone! I&rsquo;m so glad
you found them! They are the ones that mamma used
to have.&rdquo; Then, looking up for the first time, she said:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are the young man who saved my
brother&rsquo;s life. Won&rsquo;t you please come in? I think you
were perfectly splendid! I want my aunt to meet you,
and we all want to thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; said the stranger,
turning as if to go. &ldquo;It was you who saved his life. I
got there just in time to watch you. You&rsquo;re some shot,
I&rsquo;ll tell the world. I sure am proud to meet you. I
didn&rsquo;t know any girl could shoot like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo; laughed Leslie. &ldquo;Our guardian
made us both learn. Please come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we want to know you,&rdquo; urged Allison.
&ldquo;Come in. We can&rsquo;t let you go like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very late,&rdquo; urged the young man.</p>
<p>But Allison put out a firm arm, and pulled him
in, shutting the door behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloudy,&rdquo; he said, turning to his aunt, &ldquo;this man
came in the nick of time, and saved me just as I was
getting woosey. That fellow sure had a grip on my
throat, and something had hit my head and taken away
all the sense I had, so I couldn&rsquo;t seem to get him off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. I noticed you were holding your
own,&rdquo; put in the stranger. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t every man would
have tackled two unknown burglars alone.&rdquo; He spoke
in a voice of deep admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I noticed you were the only man on the spot
till the parade was about over,&rdquo; said Allison, slapping
him heartily on the shoulder. &ldquo;Say, I think I&rsquo;ve seen
you before riding that motor-cycle; tell me your name,
please. I want to know you next time I see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I&rsquo;m not much to know, but I have an
idea you are. My name&rsquo;s Howard Letchworth. I
have a room over the garage, and take my meals at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
pie-shop. My motor-cycle is all the family I have
at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison laughed, and held out his hand with a warm
grip of admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Allison Cloud; and this is my sister, Leslie
Cloud, and my aunt, Miss Cloud; and this house we
call Cloudy Villa. You&rsquo;ll always be welcome whenever
you are willing to come. You&rsquo;ve saved my
life and brought back my sister&rsquo;s pearls, and put us
doubly in your debt. I&rsquo;m sure no one in this town
has a better right to be welcome here. Please sit down
a minute, and tell us who you are. You don&rsquo;t belong
to the church bunch, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen you
about the college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Letchworth, &ldquo;not this year. I&rsquo;m a
laboring man. I work over at the ship-building plant.
If everything goes well with me this winter, I may get
back to college next fall. I was a junior last year, but
I couldn&rsquo;t quite make the financial part; so I had to go
to work again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a defiance in his tone as he told it, as if
he had said, &ldquo;Now perhaps you won&rsquo;t want to know
me!&rdquo; and he had not taken the offered chair, but was
standing, as if he would not take their friendship under
false pretences.</p>
<p>But trust Allison to say the graceful thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I somehow felt you were my superior,&rdquo; he said
with his eyes full of real friendship. &ldquo;Sit down just
a minute, so we can be sure you really mean to
come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do sit down,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud. &ldquo;I was
just going to get these children a bite to eat, and
I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d like to have you share it with them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
It&rsquo;s a long time since supper, and you have been through
a good deal. Aren&rsquo;t you hungry? The pie-shop won&rsquo;t
be open this time of night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled that welcoming home smile that no
young person could resist, and the young man sat
down with a swift, furtive glance at Leslie. She
seemed too bright and wonderful to be true. He let
his eyes wander about the charming room; the fire, the
couch, the lamplight on the books, the little home
touches everywhere, and then he sank into the big
cushions of the chair gratefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this is wonderful!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
known what home was like for seven years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s almost that long since we had a real
home, too,&rdquo; said Leslie gravely; &ldquo;and we love this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Allison, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve just got this home,
and we sure do appreciate it. I hope, if you like it,
you&rsquo;ll often share it with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I call that generous to an utter stranger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Julia Cloud entered with a tray, and Allison
and Leslie both jumped up to help her. Leslie brought
a plate with wonderful frosted cakes and little sandwiches,
which somehow Julia Cloud always managed to
have just ready to serve; Allison passed the cups of hot
chocolate with billows of whipped cream on the top, and
they all sat down before the fire to eat in the coziest
way. Suddenly, right in the midst of their talk the
big grandfather clock in the corner chimed softly out
a single clear, reminding stroke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Cloudy! It&rsquo;s one o&rsquo;clock! Sunday morning,
and here we are having a Sunday-morning party,
after all, right at home!&rdquo; laughed Leslie teasingly.</p>
<p>The stranger stood up with apology.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t go for a minute,&rdquo; said Leslie.
&ldquo;I want you to do one more thing for me. Now,
Allison, I can see it in your eyes that you mean to get
ahead of me, but I have first chance. He&rsquo;s my find.
Mr. Letchworth, you don&rsquo;t happen to belong to a Christian
Endeavor Society anywhere, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The startled young man shook his head, a look
of being on his guard suddenly coming into his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I look like it?&rdquo; he asked half comically, suddenly
glancing down at his muddy, greasy garments
and old torn sweater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then I want you to come to the meeting
to-morrow night&ndash;&ndash;no, to-night, at seven o&rsquo;clock, down
at that little brick church on the next street. Everybody
had to promise to bring some one who has never
come before, and I didn&rsquo;t have anybody to ask because
all the college people I know are off at a house-party;
and I ran away from it, and came home; so I couldn&rsquo;t
very well ask them. Will you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man looked at the lovely girl with a
smile on his lips that might easily have grown into a
sneer and a curt refusal; but somehow the clear, true
look in her eyes made refusal impossible. Against all
his prejudices he hesitated, and then suddenly said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll go if you want me to. I&rsquo;m not in the
habit of going to such places, but&ndash;&ndash;if you want me,
I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put her slim, cool hand into his, and thanked
him sweetly; and he went out into the starlight feeling
as if a princess had knighted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; sighed Leslie as the sound of his motor-cycle
died away in the distance. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s a real
man. It&rsquo;s queer; but he and Jane Bristol are the nicest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
people we&rsquo;ve met in this town yet, and they both work
for their living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just thinking that, too,&rdquo; said Allison, vigorously
poking the fire into a shower of ruby sparks.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like him, Cloudy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud emphatically. &ldquo;He looks
as if he took life in earnest. But come, don&rsquo;t you think
we better go to bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they all lay down to sleep at last, Julia Cloud
too profoundly thankful for words in the prayer her
heart fervently breathed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>
<p>The routine of college classes became settled at
last, and gradually the young people found bits
of leisure for the family life which they craved
and loved. Allison came in one day, and announced
that he had bought a canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a peach, Cloudy, and I got it cheap from a
fellow that has to leave college. His father has got
a job out in California, and they are going to move,
and want to transfer him to a Western college so he
won&rsquo;t be so far away from them. I got it for fifteen
dollars with all the outfit, and it&rsquo;s only been used one
season. But he couldn&rsquo;t take it with him. There are
three paddles and two cushions and some rugs belonging
to it, and I&rsquo;ve arranged to keep it down behind
the inn so it won&rsquo;t be far for us to go to it. Now, I
want you to be ready to take a trial trip this afternoon
at three when Leslie and I get through our classes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With much inward questioning but entire loyalty
Julia Cloud yielded herself to the uncertainties of canoeing,
but it needed but that first trip to make her an
ardent admirer of that form of recreation. Re-creation
it really seemed to her to be, as she sank among the
pillows in the comfortable nest the children had prepared
for her, and felt herself glide out upon the smooth
bosom of the creek into the glow of the autumn afternoon.
For in the shelter of the winding ravine where
the creek wandered the frost had not yet completed its
work, and the trees were still in glowing colors, blending
brilliantly with the dark green of the hemlock. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
few stark trunks were bare and bleak against the sky
in unsheltered places, but for the most part the banks
of the creek still set forth a most pleasing display to
the nature-lover who chose to come and see. Winding
dark and soft and still, with braided ripples here and
there, and little floating brown leaves that slithered
against the boat as they passed, the creek meandered
between the hills, now turning almost upon itself around
a mossy, grassy stretch of meadow-land, skirting a
chestnut-grove, or slipping beneath great rocks that
cropped out on the hillside, where moss had crept in
a lovely carpet, and graceful hemlocks found a foothold
and leaned over to dip in the water and brush the
faces of those who passed. Up, up, and up, through
the frantic little rapids that bubbled and fought and
were conquered, into the stiller waters above, between
banks all dark and green and quiet, most brilliantly and
cunningly embroidered with exquisite squawberry vines
and scarlet berries. It was most entrancing, and Julia
Cloud was reluctant to come home. No need ever to
coax her any more. She was ready always to go in
that canoe, jealous of anything that prevented a
chance to go.</p>
<p>Often she and Cherry, instead of getting a hot
lunch at home, would put up the most delectable lunch
in paper boxes, and when the children came home she
would be ready to go right down to the canoe and spend
two delightful hours floating up and down the creek
and eating an unconscionable number of sandwiches
and cakes. This happened most often on Wednesdays,
when the children had no classes from eleven o&rsquo;clock
until three and there was time to take the noon hour in
a leisurely way. Not even cool weather coming on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
could daunt them. Steamer-rugs and warm sweaters
and gloves were requisitioned, and the open-air lunches
went on just the same. One day they took a pot of
hot soup and three small bowls and spoons. They
landed at the great rocks, and, climbing up, built a
fire and gave their soup another little touch of heat
before they ate it. Such experiences welded their hearts
more and more together, and Julia Cloud came to be
more and more a part of the lives of these two young
people who had taken her for their mother-in-love.</p>
<p>It was on these outings that they talked over serious
problems: whether Leslie should join one of the girls&rsquo;
sororities, what they should do about the next Christian
Endeavor meeting, why it was that Howard
Letchworth and Jane Bristol were so much more interesting
than any of their other friends, why Cloudy
did not like to have Myrtle Villers come to the house,
and what Allison was going to do in life when he got
through with college. They were absolutely one in all
their thoughts and wishes just at this time, and there
was not anything that any one of them would not
willingly talk over with the others. It was a beautiful
relation, and one that Julia Cloud daily, tremblingly
prayed might last, might find nothing to break it up.</p>
<p>By this time the young people had begun to bring
their college mates to the house, and everybody up
there was crazy for an invitation to the little lunches
and dinners and pleasant evening gatherings that had
begun to be so popular. There were not wanting the
usual &ldquo;boy-crazy&rdquo; girls, who went eagerly trailing
Allison, literally begging him for rides and attention,
and making up to Julia Cloud and Leslie in the most
sickening of silly girl fashions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></div>
<p>And of these Myrtle Villers was at once the most
subtle and least attractive. Julia Cloud had an intuitive
shrinking from her at the start, although she tried
in her sweet, Christian way to overcome it and do as
much for this girl as she was trying to do for all the
others who came into their home. But Myrtle Villers
was quick to understand, and played her part so well
that it was impossible to shake her off as some might
have been shaken. She studied Leslie like an artist,
and learned how to play upon her frank, emotional,
impulsive nature. She confided in her, telling the sorrows
of an unloved life, and her longings for great
and better things, and fell to attending Christian Endeavor
most strenuously. She was always coming
home with Leslie for overnight and being around in
the way.</p>
<p>Allison did not like her in the least, and Julia
Cloud barely tolerated her; but, as the weeks went by,
Leslie began to champion her, to tell the others they
were unfair to the girl, and that she really had a sincere
heart and a lovely nature, which had been crushed by
loneliness and sorrow. Allison always snorted angrily
when Leslie got off anything like that, and habitually
absented himself whenever he knew &ldquo;the vamp,&rdquo; as
he called her, was to be there.</p>
<p>It was one day quite late in the fall, almost their
last balmy picnic before the cold weather set in, that
they were sitting up on the rocks around a pleasant,
resinous pine-needle fire they had made, discussing
this. Allison was maintaining that it was not good
for Leslie to go with a girl like that, that all the fellows
despised; and Leslie was pouting and saying she didn&rsquo;t
see why he had to be so prejudiced and unfair; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
Julia Cloud was looking troubled and wondering
whether her heart and her head were both on the
wrong side, or what she ought to do about it, when
a step behind them made them all turn around startled.
It was the first time they had been interrupted by an
intruder in this retreat, and it had come to seem all
their own. Moreover, the cocoa on the fire was boiling,
and the lunch was about to be served on the little
paper plates.</p>
<p>There stood a tall man with a keen, care-worn face,
a scholarly air, and an unmistakably wistful look in
his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, is this where you spend your nooning,
Cloud? It certainly looks inviting,&rdquo; he said with a
comprehensive glance at the wax-papered sandwiches
and the little heap of cakes and fruit.</p>
<p>Allison arose with belated recognition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Dr. Bowman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let me introduce you
to my aunt, Miss Cloud, and my sister Leslie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scholarly gentleman bowed low in acknowledgment
of the introduction, and fairly seemed to melt
under the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, this certainly is delightful!&rdquo; he said,
still eying the generously spread rock table. &ldquo;Quite
an idea! Quite an idea! Is this some special occasion,
some celebration or something?&rdquo; He glanced genially
round on the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, we often bring our lunch out here,&rdquo;
said Julia Cloud in a matter-of-fact tone. &ldquo;It keeps
us out-of-doors, and makes a pleasant change.&rdquo; There
was finality in her tone, and a sensitive-minded professor
would have moved on at once, for the cocoa
was boiling over, and had to be rescued, and he might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
have seen they did not want him; but he lingered affably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that certainly is an original idea. Quite so.
It really makes one quite hungry to think of it. That
certainly looks like an attractive repast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing for it but to invite him to partake,
which Allison did as curtly as he dared, considering
that the intruder was one of his major professors,
and hoping sincerely that he would refuse.
But Professor Bowman did not refuse. No such good
chance, and quite to Julia Cloud&rsquo;s annoyance&ndash;&ndash;for she
wanted to have the talk out with her children&ndash;&ndash;he sat
himself down on the rock as if he were quite acclimated
to picnics in November, and accepted so many sandwiches
that Leslie, seated slightly behind and out of
his sight, made mock signs of horror lest there should
not be enough to go around.</p>
<p>It appeared that he had started out to search for his
pocket-knife, which his young son had borrowed and
lost somewhere in that region as nearly as he could
remember, and thus had come upon the picnickers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old pill!&rdquo; growled Allison gruffly when at last
the unwelcome guest had departed hastily to a class,
with many praises for his dinner and a promise to call
to see them in the near future. &ldquo;Old pill! Now we&rsquo;ll
never dare to come here again as long as he&rsquo;s around.
Bother him. I wish I&rsquo;d told him to go to thunder.
We don&rsquo;t want him. He lives right up here over that
bluff. His wife&rsquo;s dead, and his sister or aunt or
something keeps house for him. She looks like a bottle
of pickles! Say, Cloudy, we&rsquo;ll just be out evenings
for a while till he forgets it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dr. Bowman did not forget it as Allison had
hoped. He came the very next week on a stormy night
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
when no one in his senses would go out if he could
help it; and there were the gay little household, with
the addition of Jane Bristol and Howard Letchworth,
down on their knees before the fire, roasting chestnuts,
toasting marshmallows, and telling stories. His grim,
angular presence descended upon the joyous gathering
like a wet blanket; and the young people subsided into
silence until Leslie, rising to the occasion, went to the
piano and started them all singing. A wicked little
spirit seemed to possess her, and she picked out the most
jazzy rag-time she could find, hoping to freeze out the
unwelcome guest, but he sat with patient set smile,
and endured it, making what he seemed to think were
little pleasantries to Julia Cloud, who sat by, busy
with some embroidery. She, poor lady, was divided
between a wicked delight at the daring of the children
and a horror of reproach that they should be treating
a college professor in this rude manner. She certainly
gave him no encouragement; and, when he at last rose
to go, saying he had spent a very pleasant and profitable
evening getting acquainted with his students, and he
thought he should soon repeat it, she did not ask him
to return. But he was a man of the kind who needs no
encouragement, and he did return many times and
often, until he became a fixed institution, which taxed
all their faculties inventing ways of escape from him.
The winter went, and Dr. Bowman became the one fly
in the pleasant ointment of Cloud Villa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just have to send Cloudy away awhile, or
put her to bed and pretend she is sick every time he
comes, or something!&rdquo; said Leslie one night, after his
departure had made them free to express their feelings.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tried everything else. He just won&rsquo;t take a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
hint! What do you say, Cloudy; will you play sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; said Julia Cloud aghast, &ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t
come to see me! What on earth put that in your
head?&rdquo; Her face was flaming scarlet, and distress
showed in every feature.</p>
<p>The children fairly shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear, old, blind Cloudy, of course he does!
Who on earth else would he come to see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud, tears coming into her eyes,
&ldquo;he mustn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t want to see him! Mercy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Cloudy; you should worry! I&rsquo;ll
go tell him so if you want me to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allison! You wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Julia Cloud,
aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not, Cloudy, but we&rsquo;ll find a way
to get rid of the old pill if we have to move away for
a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the old pill continued to come early
and often, and there seemed no escape; for he was continually
stealing in on their privacy at the most unexpected
times and acting as if he were sure of a welcome.
The children froze him, and were rude, and Julia
Cloud withdrew farther and farther; but nothing
seemed to faze him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad to have so much sweetness wasted,&rdquo;
mocked Leslie one night at the supper-table when their
unwelcome visitor had been a subject of discussion.
&ldquo;Miss Detliff is eating her heart out for him. She&rsquo;s
always noseying round in the hall when his class
is out, and it&rsquo;s about time for hers to begin, just
to get a word with him. She kept us waiting for our
papers ten whole minutes the other day while she discussed
better classroom ventilation with him. &lsquo;O
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
Doctah, don&rsquo;t you think we might do something about
this mattah of ventilation?&rsquo;&rdquo; she mimicked, convulsing
Allison with her likeness to her English teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an idea!&rdquo; said Allison suddenly. &ldquo;No,
don&rsquo;t ask me what it is. It would spoil things. Cloudy,
may I bring a guest to dinner to-morrow night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, anybody you please,&rdquo; replied Julia
Cloud innocently; and the incorrigible Allison appeared
the next afternoon with Miss Detliff, smiling
and pleased, sitting up in the back seat of the car.
Julia Cloud received her graciously, and never so much
as suspected anything special was going on until later
in the evening, when Dr. Bowman arrived and was
ushered in to find his colaborer there before him. He
did not look especially pleased, and Julia Cloud caught
a glance of intelligence passing between Leslie and
Allison, with a sudden revelation of a plot behind it
all. During the entire evening she sat quietly, saying
little, but her eyes dancing with the fun of it. What
children they were, and how she loved them! yes,
and what a child she was herself! for she couldn&rsquo;t help
loving their pranks as well as they did.</p>
<p>However, though Dr. Bowman had to take Miss
Detliff home, and got very little satisfaction out of his
call that evening, it did not discourage him in the least,
and Julia Cloud decided that extreme measures were
necessary to rid them of his presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might go away during Thanksgiving week;
only there&rsquo;s the Christian Endeavor banquet,&rdquo; said
Leslie. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t be away from that. And then
I wanted to have Jane to dinner. She&rsquo;s gone up to
college this week to live. She&rsquo;s doing office work there,
and she&rsquo;ll be alone on Thanksgiving Day.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and there&rsquo;s Howard. I thought we&rsquo;d have
him here,&rdquo; put in Allison dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; said Julia Cloud determinedly. &ldquo;And
we don&rsquo;t want to go away, anyway. You children run
up to your rooms this evening and study. Stay there,
I mean, no matter who comes. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a curious look at her they both obeyed; and a
little later, when the knocker sounded through the
house, they sat silently above, not daring to move,
and heard their aunt open the door, heard Dr.
Bowman&rsquo;s slow, scholarly voice and Julia Cloud&rsquo;s even
tones, back and forth for a little while, and then heard
the front door open and shut again, and slow steps go
down the brick terrace and out to the sidewalk.</p>
<p>What passed in that interview no one ever knew.
Julia Cloud came to the foot of the stairs, and called
them down, and her eyes were shining and confident as
she sat by the lamp and sewed while they studied
and joked in front of the fire; but the unwelcome guest
came no more, and whenever they met him in the street,
or at receptions, or passing at a college game, he gave
them a distant, pleasant bow; that was all. Julia Cloud
had done the work well, however she had done it. The
little Bowmans need not look to her to fill their mother&rsquo;s
place, for she was not so minded.</p>
<p>Meantime, the winter had been going on, and the
little pink-and-white house was becoming popular
among the students at college as well as among the
members of the Christian Endeavor Society of the
little brick church. Many an evening specially picked
groups of girls or boys or both spent before that fire,
playing games, and talking, and singing. Sometimes
the college glee-club came down and had dinner. Again
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
it was the football team that was feasted. Another time
Allison&rsquo;s frat came for his birthday, aided and abetted
by his sister and aunt.</p>
<p>Jane Bristol became a frequent visitor, though not
so frequent as they would have liked to have her,
for her time was very much taken up with her work
and her studies. Julia Cloud often wished she might
lift the financial burden from the young shoulders and
make things easier for her, both for her own sake and
Leslie&rsquo;s, who would have liked to make her her constant
companion; but Jane Bristol was too independent to
let anybody help her, and there seemed no way to do
anything about it. Meantime, Myrtle Villers improved
each idle hour, and kept Leslie busy inventing excuses
to get away from her, and Julia Cloud busy worrying.
Leslie was so dear, but she was also self-willed. And
she would go off with that wild girl in the car for long
rides. Not that Julia Cloud worried about the driving;
for Leslie was most careful, and handled a car as if
she had been born with the knowledge, as indeed she did
all things athletic; but her aunt distrusted the other girl.</p>
<p>And then one clear, cold afternoon in December
Leslie went off for a ride in the car with Myrtle. Of
course Julia Cloud did not know that the girl had
pestered the life out of Leslie for the ride, and had
finally promised that, if she would go, she would stop
going with a certain wild boy in the village of whom
Leslie disapproved. Neither did she know that Leslie
had resolved never to go again without her aunt along.
So she sat at the window through the short winter
afternoon, and watched and waited in vain for the car
to return; and Allison came back at half-past six after
basket-ball practice, and still Leslie had not appeared.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>
<p>There had been a little friction between Allison
and Leslie about the use of the car. Allison
had always been most generous with it until
his sister took up this absurd intimacy with Myrtle
Villers. It has been rather understood between them
that Leslie should use the car afternoons when she
wanted it, as Allison was busy with basket-ball and
other things; but several times Allison had objected
to his sister&rsquo;s taking her new friend out, and Leslie
told him he was unfair. After a heated discussion
they had left the question still unsettled. In fact, it
did not seem that it could be settled, for Leslie was
of such a nature that great opposition only made her
more firm; and Julia Cloud advised her nephew to say
nothing more for a time. Let Leslie find out for herself
the character of the girl she had made her friend.
It was really the only way she would learn not to be
carried away by flattery and high-sounding words.
Allison, grumbling a little, assented; but in his heart
he still boiled with rage at the idea of that girl&rsquo;s winding
his sister around her little finger just for the sake
of using the car when she wanted it. It was not,
perhaps, all happening that for two or three days
Allison had left the switch-key where his sister
could not find it, and a hot war of words ended
in Leslie&rsquo;s quietly ordering a new switch-key so
that such a happening would be impossible in future,
She would have one of her own. A card had come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
that very morning from the express office, notifying
Leslie that there was a package there waiting for her;
so, when she started out with Myrtle, she stopped and
got it. She tossed it carelessly into the car with a feeling
of satisfaction that now Allison could not hamper
her movements any longer by his carelessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way shall we go?&rdquo; she asked as she always
did when taking her friends out, and Myrtle named a
favorite pike where they often drove.</p>
<p>Out upon the smooth, white road they sped, rejoicing
in the clear beauty of the day and in the freedom
with which they flew through space. Myrtle had
chosen to sit in the back seat, and lolled happily among
rugs and wraps, keeping a keen eye out on the road
ahead and chattering away like a magpie to Leslie, telling
her what a darling she was&ndash;&ndash;she pronounced it
&ldquo;dolling&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and how this ride was just the one thing
she needed to recuperate from her violent study of the
night before, incident to an examination that morning.
Myrtle professed to be utterly overcome and exhausted
by the physical effort of writing for three whole hours
without a let-up. If Leslie could have seen her meagre
paper, through which a much-tortured professor was
at that moment wearily plodding, she would have been
astonished. Leslie herself was keen and thorough in
her class work, and had no slightest conception of what
a lazy student could avoid when she set herself to do so.</p>
<p>Five miles from home two masculine figures came
in sight ahead, strolling leisurely down the road. Any
one watching might have seen Myrtle suddenly
straighten up and cast a hasty glance at Leslie. But
Leslie with bright cheeks and shining eyes was forging
ahead, regardless of stray strollers.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>At exactly the right moment Myrtle leaned forward,
and clutched Leslie&rsquo;s shoulder excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Leslie! That&rsquo;s my cousin Fred Hicks! And
that must be his friend, Bartram Laws! They&rsquo;re out
for a hike. How lucky! Stop a minute, please; I
want to speak to my cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same moment the two young men turned,
with a well-timed lifting of surprised hats in response
to Myrtle&rsquo;s violent waving and shouting.</p>
<p>Leslie of course slowed down. She could not
carry a girl past her own cousin when she asked to stop
to speak to him; besides, it never occurred to her not
to do so.</p>
<p>Myrtle went through the introductions glibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Laws, meet my friend Miss Cloud; my cousin,
Fred Hicks, Leslie. Pile in, boys! Isn&rsquo;t this great
that we should meet? Out for a hike? We&rsquo;ll give
you a lift. Which way are you going? Fred, you can
sit in front with Leslie. I want Bart back here
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie caught her breath in a troubled hesitancy.
This wasn&rsquo;t the kind of thing she had bargained for.
It was the sort of thing that her aunt and brother
would object to most strenuously. Yet how could she
object when her guest had asked them? Of course
Myrtle didn&rsquo;t realize that it was not quite the thing
for them to be off here in the country unchaperoned,
with two strange young men, though of course they
weren&rsquo;t strangers really, both of them friends of
Myrtle&rsquo;s, and one her cousin. Myrtle could not be
expected to think how it would seem to her.</p>
<p>But the young men were not waiting for Leslie&rsquo;s
invitation. They seemed to feel that their company
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
would be ample compensation for any objections that
might be had. They scrambled in with alacrity.</p>
<p>The color flew into Leslie&rsquo;s cheeks. In her heart
she said they were altogether too &ldquo;fresh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I suppose we can give you a lift for a little
way,&rdquo; said Leslie, trying to sound patronizing. &ldquo;How
far are you going? We turn off here pretty soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Cousin Fred easily;
&ldquo;any old road suits us so it&rsquo;s going in this direction.
Want me to take the wheel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Leslie coldly, &ldquo;I always
drive myself. My brother doesn&rsquo;t care for me to let
other people use the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right; I thought you might be tired,
and I&rsquo;m a great driver. People trust me that won&rsquo;t
trust any one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Leslie,&rdquo; chimed in Myrtle. &ldquo;Fred
can drive like a breeze. You ought to see him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie said nothing, but dropped in the clutch, and
drove on. She was not prepossessed in Fred Hicks&rsquo;s
favor. She let him make all the remarks, and sat like
a slim, straight, little offended goddess. But Fred
Hicks was not disturbed in the least. He started in
telling a story about a trip he took from Washington
up to Harrisburg in an incredibly brief space of time,
and he laughed uproariously at all his own jokes.
Leslie was a girl of violent likes and dislikes, and she
took one of them now. She fairly froze Cousin Fred,
though he showed no outward sign of being aware
of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a nice road off to the right,&rdquo; he indicated,
reaching out a commanding hand to the wheel suddenly.
&ldquo;Turn here.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></div>
<p>Leslie with set lips bore on past the suggested road
at high speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t touch my wheel,&rdquo; was all she said, in
a haughty little voice. She was very angry indeed.</p>
<p>They were nearing an old mansion, closed now
for the winter, with a small artificial lake between the
grounds and the highway.</p>
<p>Leslie felt a passing wish that she might dump her
undesired cargo in that lake and fly away from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you will have to get out at the next crossroads,&rdquo;
she said with more dignity. &ldquo;I have to go
home now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Leslie Cloud! You don&rsquo;t any such thing!&rdquo;
broke in Myrtle. &ldquo;You told me you could be out till
quarter of six. It&rsquo;s only half-past four! I thought
you were a good sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed my mind,&rdquo; said Leslie coldly, bringing
the car to a standstill. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back right
now. Do you and your friend want to get out here,
Mr. Hicks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred Hicks lolled back in the car, and leered
at Leslie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m particularly anxious to
get out, but I think I&rsquo;d like to change around a little.
If you&rsquo;ll just step over here, I&rsquo;ll run the car for you,
my dear. I don&rsquo;t think Myrtle is ready to go back yet.
How &rsquo;bout it, Myrt?&rdquo; He turned and deliberately
winked at Myrtle, who leaned over with a light laugh,
and patted Leslie on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, Leslie, don&rsquo;t get up in the air,&rdquo;
she soothed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain all about it if you&rsquo;ll just
turn around and go up that road back there. It won&rsquo;t
take you much longer, and we&rsquo;ll be back in plenty of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
time. The fact is, I had a little plan in the back of
my head when I came out this afternoon; and I want
you to help me out. Now be a good girl and let Fred
run the car a little while. He won&rsquo;t do it any harm,
and your brother will never know a thing about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie&rsquo;s eyes were flashing, and her head was held
haughtily; but she kept her hands firmly on the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friends will have to get out, Myrtle,&rdquo; she
said coldly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help you out in any scheme I
don&rsquo;t understand. You&rsquo;ll have to go to some one else
for that kind of help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Myrtle pouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re very nice, Leslie
Cloud, speaking in that way before my friends; but of
course you don&rsquo;t understand; I&rsquo;ll have to tell you. Bart
Laws and I are engaged, and we&rsquo;re going to a town
down in the next State to get married. Bart has the
license and the minister, and it&rsquo;s all arranged nicely.
His aunt will be there for a chaperon. If you behave
yourself and do as we tell you, the whole thing will
go off quietly and no one will know the difference.
You and I will go back home before dark, and everything
will be lovely. You see, dear, I&rsquo;ve been engaged
all this time; only I couldn&rsquo;t tell you, because my guardians
don&rsquo;t approve of my getting married until I&rsquo;m
through college. You didn&rsquo;t understand why I had
so much to do with Rich Price, but he was just a go-between
for Bart and me. Now, do you understand
why I wanted you to go this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Myrtle&rsquo;s voice was very soft and insinuating. She
had tears always near the surface for ready use. &ldquo;You
never have been in love, Leslie; you don&rsquo;t know what it
is to be separated from the one who is all the world
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
to you. Come, now, Leslie; I&rsquo;ll do anything in the
world for you if you&rsquo;ll only help me out now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I won&rsquo;t?&rdquo; asked Leslie calmly, deliberately,
as if she were really weighing the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; put in the person called
Fred Hicks, &ldquo;why, Bart and I will just fix you up
perfectly harmlessly in the back seat there, where you
can&rsquo;t do any damage&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and he put his hand in his
pocket, and brought out the end of an ugly-looking
rope&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and then we&rsquo;ll take charge of this expedition
and go on our way. You can take it or leave it as you
please. Shut up there, Myrt; we haven&rsquo;t any more
time to waste. We&rsquo;re behind schedule now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie&rsquo;s mouth shut in a pretty little tight line, and
her eyes got like two blue sparks, but her voice was
cool and steady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I <i>won&rsquo;t</i>!&rdquo; she said tensely; and with a sudden
motion she grabbed the switch-key and, springing
to her feet, flung it far out across the road, across a
little scuttled canoe that lay at the bank, and plunk into
the water, before the other occupants of the car could
realize what she was doing.</p>
<p>Fred Hicks saw just an instant too late, and sprang
for her arm to stop it, then arose in his seat with curses
on his lips, watching the exact location of the splash
and calling to his mate to go out and fish for it.</p>
<p>Leslie sank back in her seat, tense and white, and
both young men sprang out and rushed to the shore
of the little lake, leaving a stream of unspeakable language
behind them. Myrtle began to berate her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little <i>fool</i>!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You think you&rsquo;ve
stopped us, don&rsquo;t you? But you&rsquo;ll suffer for this! If
you make us late, I&rsquo;ll see that you don&rsquo;t get back to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
your blessed home for a whole week; and, when you
do, you won&rsquo;t have such a pretty reputation to go on
as you have now! It won&rsquo;t do a bit of good, either,
for those two men can find that switch-key; or, if they
can&rsquo;t, Fred knows how to start a car without one.
You&rsquo;ve only made a lot of trouble for yourself, and
that&rsquo;s all the good it will do you. You thought you
were smart, but you&rsquo;re nothing but an ignorant
little kid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the ignorant little kid was not listening. With
trembling fingers she was pulling off the wrappings
from a small package, and suddenly a warning whir cut
short Myrtle&rsquo;s harangue. She lurched forward, and
tried to pull Leslie&rsquo;s hands away from the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bart! Come quick! She&rsquo;s got another! Hurry,
boys!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>
<p>The two young men had shoved the old canoe up
on the bank, turned it over, emptied it, and
put it back in the water. Fred Hicks was
holding it at arm&rsquo;s length now in the water; and the
would-be bridegroom had crawled out to the extreme
end, and with rolled-up sleeves was pawing about in
the water, which did not appear to be very deep. At
the cry they turned; and Fred Hicks, forgetting the
other man&rsquo;s plight, let go the boat, and dashed back
to the road. Young Laws, arising too hastily, rolled
into the water completely, and came splashing up
the bank in a frothy state of mind. But suddenly, as
they came, while Myrtle&rsquo;s best efforts were put forth
to hinder Leslie&rsquo;s movements, something cold and
gleaming flashed in her face that sent her crouching
back in the corner of her seat and screaming. Leslie
had slipped her hand into the little secret pocket of
the car door and brought out her revolver, hoping fervently
that it was still loaded, and that Allison had not
chosen to shoot at a mark or anything with it the last
time he was out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better sit down and keep quiet,&rdquo; she said
coolly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a good shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she put her foot on the clutch, and the car
started just as Fred Hicks lit on the running-board.</p>
<p>Leslie&rsquo;s little revolver came promptly around to
meet him, and he dropped away with a gasp of surprise
as suddenly as he had lit. Suddenly Leslie became
aware of the other young man dripping and breathless,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
but with a dangerous look in his eye, bearing down
upon her from the lake side of the road; and she flashed
around and sent a shot ringing out into the road, the
bullet ploughing into the dust at his very feet. The
car leaped forward to obey her touch, and in a
second more they had left the two young men safely
behind them.</p>
<p>Myrtle was crouched in the back seat, weeping; and
Leslie, cool and brave in the front seat, was trembling
from head to foot. This was a new road to her; at
least, she had never been more than two or three miles
on it, and she did not know where she would bring up.
She began to wonder how long her gasoline would hold
out, for she had been in such a hurry to get away with
Myrtle before Allison should come home that she had
forgotten to look to see if everything was all right; and
she now remembered that Allison had had the car out
late the night before. Everything seemed to be falling
in chaos about her. The earth rose and fell in front
of her excited gaze; the sun was going down; and the
road ahead seemed endless, without a turning as far as
she could see.</p>
<p>A great burying-ground stretched for what seemed
like miles along one side of the road. The polished
marble gleamed red and bleak in the setting sun. The
sky had suddenly gone lead-color, and there was a chill
in the air. Leslie longed for nothing so much as to
hide her head in Julia Cloud&rsquo;s lap and weep. Yet she
must go on and on and on till this awful road came
to an end. Would it <i>ever</i> come to an end? Oh, it <i>must</i>
somewhere! A great tower of bricks loomed ahead
with a wide paved driveway leading to it through an
arched gateway, and over the arch some words. Leslie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
got only one of them, &ldquo;CREMATORY.&rdquo; She shuddered,
and put on speed. It seemed that she had come
to the place of death and desolation. It was lonely
everywhere, and not a soul in sight. What horror if
her gasoline should give out in a place like this, and
they have to spend the night here, she and that poor,
weak creature sobbing behind! What contempt she
felt for her former friend! What contempt she felt
for herself! Oh, she was well punished for her wilfulness!
To think she should have presumed to hope
she could help her to better ways, she, a little innocent,
who never dreamed of such depths of duplicity as
had been shown her that afternoon! Oh, to think of
that loathsome Hicks person daring to touch her! To
try to take her car away from her! and to <i>smile</i> at her
in that disgusting way!</p>
<p>On and on went the car, and the road wound away
into the dusk up a high hill and down again, up another,
past an old farmhouse with one dim light in the
back window and a great dog howling like one in
some old classic tale she had read; on and on, till at
last a cross-road came, and she knew not which way
to take, to right or to left. There was a sign-board;
but it was too dark to read, and she dared not get out
and leave Myrtle. There was no telling but she might
try to run off with the car. It was at the crematory
that she began to pray, and, when she reached the
crossing, her heart put up a second plea for guidance.
&ldquo;O God, if You will just help me home, I will try, <i>try</i>,
<span class='smcap'>try</span> to be what You want me to be! Please, please,
<i>please</i>!&rdquo; It was the old vow of a heart bowed down
and brought to the limit. It was the first time Leslie
had ever realized that there could be a situation in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
which Leslie Cloud would not find some way out. It
was the first time, too, perhaps, when she realized herself
as being a sinner in the sense of having a will
against God and having exercised it for her own pleasure
rather than for His glory.</p>
<p>Down the road to the left the car sped, and after
a mile and a half of growing darkness, with woods and
scattered farmhouses, the lights of a village began to
appear. But it was no village that Leslie knew, and
nothing anywhere gave her a clew. A trolley line
appeared, however; and after a little a car came along
with a name that showed it was going cityward. Leslie
decided to follow the trolley track.</p>
<p>In the meantime the girl in the back seat roused up,
and began to look about her, evidently recognizing
something familiar in the streets or town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can put me out here, Leslie; I&rsquo;m done with
you,&rdquo; she said haughtily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to go any
farther with you. I&rsquo;ll go back on the train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Leslie sharply. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go home
with me. I took you away without knowing what you
intended, but I mean to put you back where you were
before I&rsquo;m done. Then my responsibility for you will
be over. I was a fool to let you deceive me that way,
but I&rsquo;m not a fool any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> go home with you, so! and that&rsquo;s
flat, Leslie Cloud. You needn&rsquo;t think you can frighten
me into going, either. We&rsquo;re in a village now, and
my aunt lives here. If you get out that revolver again,
I&rsquo;ll scream and have you arrested, and tell them you&rsquo;re
trying to murder me; so there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer Leslie turned sharply into a cross-road
that led away from the settled portion of the town, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
put on all speed, tearing away into the dusk like a wild
creature. Myrtle screamed and stormed behind her, all
to no purpose. Leslie Cloud had her mettle up, and
meant to take her prisoner home. Out of the town she
turned into another road that ran parallel to the trolley
track, from which she could see the lights of the trolleys
passing now and again, as it grew darker; and by and
by when they came to another cross-road, Leslie got
back to the trolley track, and followed it; but whenever
they came into a town she kept to its outskirts.</p>
<p>Leslie had a pretty good general sense of direction,
and she knew just where the sun went down. If it had
not been for a river and some hills that turned up and
bewildered her, she would have made a pretty direct
course home; but, as it was, she went far out of her
way, and was long delayed and much distressed besides,
being continually harassed by the angry girl in the
back seat. The gasoline was holding out. It was evident
that Allison had looked after it. Blessed
Allison, who always did everything when he
ought to do it, and never put off things until the next
day! How cross she had been with him for the last
six weeks, and how good and kind he always was to her!
How she had deceived dear Cloudy and troubled her
by going off this afternoon! Oh, what would they
think? Would they ever forgive her, and take her
back into their hearts, and trust her again? The tears
were blurring her eyes now as she stared ahead at the
road. It seemed as if she had been tearing on through
the night for hours like this. Her arms ached with the
nervous strain; her back ached; her head ached. Perhaps
they were going around the world, and would
only stop when the gasoline gave out!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>They swept around a curve. Could it be that those
were the lights of the college ahead on the hill? Oh,
joy at last! They were! Up this hill, over across two
blocks, and the little pink-and-white house would be
nestled among the hemlocks; and rest and home at last!
But there was something to be done first. She turned
toward the back seat, where sat her victim silent
and angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can let me out now, Leslie Cloud,&rdquo;
said Myrtle scornfully. &ldquo;I suppose you won&rsquo;t dare
lord it over me any longer, and I&rsquo;ll take good care that
the rest of the town understands what a dangerous little
spitfire <i>you</i> are. You ought to be arrested for this
night&rsquo;s work! That&rsquo;s all <i>I&rsquo;ve</i> got to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have one more thing to say,&rdquo; said Leslie
slowly, as she swerved into her own street and her
eyes hungrily sought for the lights of Cloudy Villa.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming into the house with me first, before
you go anywhere else, and you&rsquo;re going to tell this
whole story to my Aunt Jewel. After that&ndash;&ndash;<i>I
should worry</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I rather guess I am not going into your
old house and tell your old aunt anything! I&rsquo;m going
to get right out here this minute; and you&rsquo;re good and
going to <i>let</i> me out, too, or I&rsquo;ll scream bloody murder,
and tell it all over this town how you went out there to
meet those boys. You haven&rsquo;t got any witnesses, and
<i>I have</i>, remember!&rdquo; said Myrtle, suddenly feeling
courageous now that she was back among familiar
streets.</p>
<p>But Leslie turned sharply into the little drive, and
brought up the car in a flood of light at the end of
the terrace.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, get out!&rdquo; she ordered, swinging the door
open and flashing her little revolver about again at
the angry girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Leslie!&rdquo; pleaded the victim, quickly quelled
by the sight of the cold steel, and thrilled with the
memory of that shot whistling by her into the road a
few hours before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; said Leslie coolly as the front door
was flung open and Julia Cloud peered through the
brightness of the porch light into the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; Leslie held the cold steel nearer to
Myrtle&rsquo;s face, and the girl shuddered, and got out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now go into the house!&rdquo; she ordered; and shuddering,
shivering, with a frightened glance behind her
and a fearful glance ahead, she walked straight into
the wondering, shocked presence of Julia Cloud, who
threw the door open wide and stepped aside to let
them in. Leslie, with the revolver still raised, and
pointed toward the other girl, came close behind Myrtle,
who sidled hastily around to get behind Miss Cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Leslie! What is the matter?&rdquo; gasped
Julia Cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her!&rdquo; ordered Leslie, the revolver still
pointed straight at Myrtle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I tell?&rdquo; gasped the other girl, turning
a white, miserable face toward Miss Cloud as if to
appeal to her leniency. But there was a severity in
Julia Cloud&rsquo;s face now after her long hours of anxiety
that boded no good for the cause of all her alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her the whole story!&rdquo; ordered the fierce
young voice of Leslie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we went out to take a ride,&rdquo; began Myrtle,
looking up with her old braggadocio. There had seldom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
been a time when Myrtle had not been able to get
out of a situation by use of her wily tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell it all,&rdquo; said Leslie, looking across the barrel
of her weapon. &ldquo;Tell who wanted to go on that ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I asked Leslie to take me. I&ndash;&ndash;we&ndash;&ndash;well,
that is&ndash;&ndash;I wanted to meet a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell it straight!&rdquo; ordered Leslie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course I didn&rsquo;t tell Leslie I expected to
meet them&ndash;&ndash;him. I wasn&rsquo;t just sure he could make the
arrangements. I meant to tell her when we got out.
And when we met him&ndash;&ndash;and my cousin&ndash;&ndash;it was my
cousin I was to meet&ndash;&ndash;you see I&rsquo;m&ndash;&ndash;we&ndash;&ndash;he&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Myrtle was getting all tangled up with her glib
tongue under the clear gaze of Julia Cloud&rsquo;s truth-compelling
eyes. She looked up and down, and twisted
the fringe on her sash, and turned red and white by
turns, and seemed for the first time a very young, very
silly child. But Leslie had suffered, and just now
Leslie had no mercy. This girl had been a kind of
idol to whom she had sacrificed much, and now that
her idol had fallen she wanted to make the idol pay.
Or no, was that it? Leslie afterwards searched her
heart, and felt that she could truly say that her strongest
motive in compelling this confession had been to get
the burden of the knowledge of it off her own shrinking
soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the rest!&rdquo; came the relentless voice of
Leslie, and Myrtle struggled on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m engaged to Mr. Bartram Laws; and
my guardian won&rsquo;t let us get married till I&rsquo;m through
college, and we fixed it up to get married to-day quietly.
I knew it would be all right after he found out he
couldn&rsquo;t help himself, and so&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell how you asked the boys to get in the car!&rdquo;
ordered the fierce voice again; and Myrtle, recalled
from another attempt to pass it all off pleasantly, went
step by step through the whole shameful story until it
was complete.</p>
<p>Then Leslie with a sudden motion of finality flung
the little weapon down upon the mahogany table, and
dashed into Julia Cloud&rsquo;s arms in a storm of tears.
&ldquo;O Cloudy, I&rsquo;ll never, never do any such thing again!
And I hate her! I <i>hate</i> her! I&rsquo;ll never forgive her!
Can you ever forgive <i>me</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one had heard a sudden, startled exclamation
from the porch room as Leslie and Myrtle came into
the house; but now Myrtle suddenly looked up, thinking
the time had come for her to steal away unseen;
and there in the two doorways that opened on either
side of the fireplace stood, on one side Allison Cloud
and the dean of the college, and on the other side two
members of the student executive body, all looking
straight at her! Moreover, she read it in their eyes
that they had heard every word of her confession.
Without a word she dropped white and stricken into
a chair, and covered her face with her hands. For
once her brazen wiles were gone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>
<p>It happened that Miss Myrtle Villers had not confined
her affections to Mr. Bartram Laws. She
had been seen wandering about the campus with
other youths at odd hours of the evening when young-lady
students were supposed to be safely within college
halls or properly chaperoned at some public gathering.
The &ldquo;student exec&rdquo; had had her in tow for several
weeks, and she had already received a number of reproofs
and warnings. A daring escapade the evening
before had brought matters to a head, and it was very
possibly because of some suspicion that they might
have found her out that Myrtle had made her plans
to be absent on that afternoon. However that was,
when the executive body in consultation with the dean
sent for her, they traced her to the Clouds&rsquo; house.
At least, they came there about seven o&rsquo;clock to inquire
and hoping to take her unaware. They had found
Allison in a great state of excitement, telephoning
hither and yon to try to get some clew to his sister&rsquo;s
whereabouts. They had remained to advise and suggest,
greatly worried at the whole situation, the more
so because it involved Leslie Cloud, whose bright
presence had taken great hold upon everybody.</p>
<p>And now, without knowing it, Leslie Cloud had
taken the one way to put the whole matter into the
right hands and to exonerate herself. If she had known
that any member of the faculty was in that room listening,
if she had dreamed that even her brother was
there, she would not have thought it right or honorable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
to put even an enemy in such a position, either for her
own sake or for the girl&rsquo;s. She had only wanted some
wise, true adviser to know the truth, so that the girl
might learn what was right and have the responsibility
taken from her own shoulders. She thought, too, that
she had a right to be exonerated before her aunt. So
now, while she wept out her contrition in Julia Cloud&rsquo;s
arms, retribution was coming swiftly to Myrtle Villers;
and her career in that college was sealed with finality.
It was only too plain that such a girl was a menace to
the other students, and needed to be removed.</p>
<p>Presently Leslie, feeling something strange in the
atmosphere, lifted frightened, tear-filled eyes, and saw
the grave faces of the dean and his companions! She
held her breath with suspense. How terrible! How
public and unseemly! She had brought all this upon
herself and her family by her persistent friendship
with this silly girl! And she fell to trembling and
shuddering, all her fine, sweet nerve gone now that the
strain was over.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud drew her down upon the couch, and
soothed her, covering her with an afghan and trying
to comfort her. Then the dean stepped over to the
couch and spoke to Leslie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Cloud, you must not feel so bad,&rdquo; he said
gently, as if she had been his own child. &ldquo;You have
acted nobly, and no one will blame you. You have
perhaps saved Miss Villers from great shame and
sorrow, and you certainly have been brave and true.
Don&rsquo;t worry, child,&rdquo; and he patted Leslie&rsquo;s heaving
shoulder kindly.</p>
<p>Presently the dean and his committee were gone,
taking the cowering Myrtle with them, and Leslie lay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
snuggled up on the couch, with Allison building up
the fire and Cherry bringing a tray with a nice supper.
Julia Cloud fixed a hot-water bag to warm the chilled
hands and feet. It was so good to be at home! The
tears rushed into her eyes again, and her throat filled
with sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Cloudy!&rdquo; She caught her aunt&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
never, never do anything again you don&rsquo;t want me to!&rdquo;
she sobbed out, and then burst into another paroxysm
of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! Now, kid! Don&rsquo;t cry any more!&rdquo;
pleaded Allison, springing to her side and kneeling by
her, smoothing her hair roughly. &ldquo;You were a little
winner! You had every bit of your nerve with you.
Why, you did a great thing, kid! Outwitting those two
brutes and bringing that girl back in spite of herself.
But the greatest thing of all was your making her
confess. Now they&rsquo;ve got something to go on. If you
hadn&rsquo;t done that, it would have been her word against
yours; and I imagine she&rsquo;s always managed to keep
things where she could get around people with her
wiles. Now she&rsquo;s got to face facts; and believe me,
kid, it&rsquo;ll be better for her in the end. She was headed
straight for a bad end, and no mistake. All the fellows
knew it, and the faculty suspected it; and it was making
no end of trouble. But now the girl may be saved,
for that dean never lets a student go to destruction,
they say, if he can help it. Oh, of course he&rsquo;ll fire her.
She isn&rsquo;t fit to be around here. But he&rsquo;ll keep an eye
on her, and he&rsquo;ll fire her in such a way that she&rsquo;ll have
another chance to make good if she&rsquo;s willing to take it.
Don&rsquo;t you worry about spoiling her life. She&rsquo;d set out
to spoil it in the first place, and the best thing that could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
possibly happen to her was to get stopped before she
went too far. From all you say I shouldn&rsquo;t think a
marriage with that fellow would have been any advantage
to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he was <i>awful</i>, Allison!&rdquo; shuddered Leslie.
&ldquo;He smelled of liquor; and he had great, coarse lips
and eyes; and he put his arms around her, and kissed
her right there before us all; and they acted perfectly
disgusting! I&rsquo;m almost sure from things I heard them
say that she hadn&rsquo;t been engaged to him at all, she
hadn&rsquo;t even known him till last week. She met him
in town&ndash;&ndash;just picked him up on the street! And that
Fred Hicks! I don&rsquo;t <i>believe</i> now he was her cousin
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not. But leave that all to the dean.
He&rsquo;ll ferret it out. He went in there to the telephone
before he left, and from what I heard I imagine he&rsquo;s
got detectives out after those two guys, and they may
sleep in the lockup to-night. They certainly deserve
to. And I shall have a hand in settling with them,
too. I can&rsquo;t have my sister treated that way and let
it go easily. They&rsquo;ve got to answer to me. There, kid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stooped down, and kissed her gently on her
hot, wet forehead; and Leslie caught his hand and
nestled her own in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Allison! It&rsquo;s so good to be home!&rdquo; she murmured,
squeezing his hand appreciatively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never,
never, <i>never</i> go with a girl again that you don&rsquo;t like.
I&rsquo;m just going to stick to Jane. She&rsquo;s the only one up
there I really love, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison seemed quite satisfied with these sentiments,
and they had a beautiful time eating their supper before
the fire, for no one had had any appetite before; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
Cherry was as pleased to have the anxiety over and
wait upon them all as if Leslie had been her own sister.</p>
<p>Into the midst of their little family group broke
a hurried, excited knock on the door, and there stood
Howard Letchworth with anxious face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard that your sister and one of the college
girls had gone off in a car and got lost. Is it true? I
came right around to see if I could help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie sat up with her teary eyes bright and eager,
and her cheeks rosy with pleasure, all her pretty hair
in a tumble about her face and the firelight playing over
her features in a most charming way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s awfully good of you,&rdquo; she called eagerly.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m perfectly all right and safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came over to the couch, and took her offered
hand most eagerly, expressing his delight, and saying
he had been almost sure it was some town gossip,
but he could not rest satisfied until he was positive.</p>
<p>But Allison would not let it go at that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell him, Leslie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He
won&rsquo;t let any one be the wiser; and, if people are saying
anything like that, he can help stop their mouths.&rdquo; So
Allison told the whole story. When it came to the
part about Fred Hicks and Bartram Laws, Howard&rsquo;s
face grew dark, and he flashed a look that boded no
good to the two young ruffians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know who that Laws fellow is,&rdquo; he said gravely.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s rotten! And I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if I could
locate his friend. I get around quite a bit on my
motor-cycle. May I use your &rsquo;phone a minute? I
have a friend who is a detective. They ought to be
rounded up. Miss Leslie, would you tell me carefully
just what roads you took, as nearly as you know?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></div>
<p>So Leslie told in detail of the wild ride once more.
Julia Cloud watched the young man&rsquo;s face as he listened,
and knew that Leslie had a faithful friend and
champion, knew also that here was one whose friendship
was well worth cultivating, a clean, fine, strong
young soul, and was glad for her little girl. Something
stirred in her memory as she watched his look,
and she went back to her childish days and the boy
friend who had kissed her when he went away never to
return. There was the same look in Howard
Letchworth&rsquo;s eyes when he looked at Leslie, the age-old
beauty of a man&rsquo;s clean devotion to a sweet, pure
woman soul.</p>
<p>Of course Leslie was a mere child yet, and was
not thinking of such things; but there need be no
fear that that fine, strong young man would be unwise
enough to let the child in her be frightened away
prematurely. They were friends now, beautiful
friends; and that would be enough for them both for a
long time. She was content.</p>
<p>She watched them all the evening, and listened
to their talk about the Christian Endeavor Society.
How beautiful it was that Leslie had been able to bring
the boy to a degree of interest in that! Of course it
was for her sake, but he was man enough to be interested
on his own account now; and from their talk she
could see that he had gone heart and soul with Allison
into the plans for the winter work. He had a fine
voice, and was to sing a solo at the next meeting. Presently
Leslie so far recovered her nerves as to smooth
out her hair and go to the piano to practise with him.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><span class='indent4'>&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;O Jesus, Thou art standing<br />
<span class='indent5'>&nbsp;</span>Outside the fast-closed door,&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></div>
<p>rang out the rich, sweet notes; and the tender, sympathetic
voice brought out each word with an appeal.
The boy could not sing like that and not feel it himself
sometime. Julia Cloud found herself praying; praying,
as if she whispered to a dear Companion sitting
close beside her at the hearthside: &ldquo;Dear Christ, show
this boy. Teach him what Thou art. Make him Thy
true disciple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the young fellow turned to Allison with
a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the way you take your religion with you
into college, Cloud. It makes it seem real. I haven&rsquo;t
met many fellows that had any before, or perhaps I
shouldn&rsquo;t have been such a heathen as I am. But I
say, why don&rsquo;t you try to get some of your frat brothers
to come down to the meeting? They ought to be
willing to do that for you, and it would be great to
have them sing. You&rsquo;ve got a lot of the glee club in
your crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; said Allison. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but
I&rsquo;ll try it. I&rsquo;d like to have them come the night you
sing. Guess I&rsquo;ll have to hunt around and get a speaker.
No, I won&rsquo;t either. Just the meeting itself is good
enough now for anybody. They&rsquo;re a pretty good little
bunch down there. They&rsquo;ve been working like beavers.
Jane Bristol gets the girls together, and coaches them
for every meeting. She&rsquo;s some girl, do you know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Howard Letchworth agreed that she was, but he
cast a side glance down at the bright head of the girl,
who was playing his accompaniment as if he felt there
were others. Julia Cloud was watching her darling
girl, wondering, hoping, praying that she might always
stay so sweet and unspoiled.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></div>
<p>But when the young man was gone home, and
Leslie came back to the couch again, she suddenly
drooped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloudy Jewel,&rdquo; she said wearily, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t right.
I don&rsquo;t deserve people to be so nice to me, the dean,
and you all, and Howard and everybody. It was a
lot my fault that all this happened. I thought I could
make that girl over if I just stuck to her. She had
promised me she would come to Christian Endeavor,
and join; and I wanted to show you all what a power
I had over her. I was just conceited; that was all
there was about it. Now I see that she was only fooling
me. I couldn&rsquo;t have done anything at all alone.
I needed God. I didn&rsquo;t ask Him to help. You&rsquo;ve
talked a lot about that in our Sunday meetings, but it
never went down into my heart until I was driving past
that old crematory, and I felt as if I was all alone
and Death all in black trailing robes was going along
fast beside me. Then I knew God was the only one
who could help, and I began to pray. I hope maybe
I&rsquo;ve learned my lesson, and I&rsquo;ll not be so swelled-headed
next time. But you oughtn&rsquo;t to forgive me, Cloudy,
not so easy. Cloudy, you&rsquo;re just like God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was several days before Leslie recovered fully
from the nervous strain she had been under. She
slept long the next day, and Julia Cloud would not
waken her. For a week there were dark circles under
the bright eyes, and the rose of her cheek was pale.
She went about meekly with downcast eyes, and the
bright fervor of her spirit seemed dimmed. It was
not until one afternoon when Allison suggested that
they get Jane Bristol and Howard Letchworth and go
for bittersweet-berry vines and hemlock-branches to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
decorate for the Christian Endeavor social that her
spirits seemed to return, and the unwholesome experience
was put away in the past at last.</p>
<p>Howard Letchworth had been most thoughtful
about the matter in the village, and had managed so
that the tragic had been taken out of the story that had
started to roll about, and Leslie could go around and
not feel that all eyes were upon her wondering about
her escapade. Gradually the remembrance of it died
out of her thoughts, although the wholesome lesson she
had learned never faded.</p>
<p>More and more popular in the college grew the
gatherings down at Cloudy Villa. Sometimes Leslie
brought home three or four girls for Friday and
Saturday, not often any on Sunday, unless it was Jane;
for Sundays were their very own day for the little
family, and they dreaded any who might seem
like intruders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is our time when we catch up in our loving
for all the week,&rdquo; Leslie explained with a quaint smile
to one girl who broadly hinted that she would not
mind being asked for over Sunday. &ldquo;And, besides,
you mightn&rsquo;t like the way we keep Sunday. Everybody
who comes has to go to church and Christian Endeavor
with us, and enjoy our Bible-reading, singing
hour around the fire; and I didn&rsquo;t think you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I like your nerve!&rdquo; answered the girl; but
she sat studying Leslie afterwards with a thoughtful
gaze, and began to wonder whether, after all, a Sunday
spent in that way might not be really interesting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a kind of a nut, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; she remarked
to another friend of Leslie&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a pretty nice kind of a nut, then, Esther,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
was the response. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s a nut, we better grow a
whole tree of them. I&rsquo;m going down there all I can.
I like &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud seemed to have a fertile brain for all
kinds of lovely ways to while away a holiday. As
the cold weather came on, winter picnics became the
glory of the hour. Long walks with heavy shoes and
warm sweaters and mittens were inaugurated. A
kettle of hot soup straight from the fire, wrapped in
a blanket and carried in a big basket, was a feature of
the lunch. When the party reached a camping-spot,
a fire would be built and the soup-kettle hung over an
improvised crane to put on its finishing touches, while
the rest of the eatables were set forth in paper plates,
each portion neatly wrapped in waxed paper ready for
easy handling. Sometimes big mince pies came along,
and were stood on edge near the fire to get thawed out.
Bean soup, corned-beef sandwiches, and hot mince pie
made a hearty meal for people who had tramped ten
or fifteen miles since breakfast.</p>
<p>Oh, how those college-fed boys and girls enjoyed
these picnics, with Julia Cloud as a kind of hovering
angel to minister with word or smile or in some more
practical way, wherever there was need! They all
called her &ldquo;Cloudy Jewel&rdquo; now whenever they dared,
and envied those who got closest to her and told her
their troubles. Many a lad or lassie brought her his or
her perplexities; and often as they sat around the
winter camp, perhaps on a rock brushed free from
snow, she gave them sage advice wrapped up in pleasant
stories that were brought in ever so incidentally.
There was nothing ever like preaching about Julia
Cloud; she did not feel that she knew enough to preach.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
And sometimes, as they walked homeward through the
twilight of a long, happy afternoon, and the streaks
of crimson were beginning to glow in the gray of the
horizon, some one or two would lag behind and ask
her deep, sweet questions about life and its meaning and
its hereafter. Often they showed her their hearts as
they had never shown them even to their own people,
and often a word with her sent some student back
to work harder and fight stronger against some subtle
temptation. She became a wholesome antidote to the
spirit of doubt and atheism that had crept stealthily
into the college and was attacking so many and undermining
what little faith in religion they had when they
came there.</p>
<p>It came to be a great delight to many of the young
college people to spend an evening around the hearth
at Cloudy Villa. There never had been any trouble
about that question of dancing, because they just did
not do it; and there was always something else going
on, some lively games, sometimes almost a &ldquo;rough-house,&rdquo;
as the boys called it, but never anything really
unpleasant. Julia Cloud was &ldquo;a good sport,&rdquo; the boys
said; and the girls delighted in her. The evenings were
filled with impromptu programmes thought out carefully
by Julia Cloud, but proposed and exploited in
the most casual manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allison, why wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good idea for you
to act out that story we were reading the other day
the next time you have some of the young people down?
You and Leslie and Jane with the help of one or two
others could do it, and there wouldn&rsquo;t be much to learn.
If you all read it over once or twice more, you&rsquo;d have
it so you could easily extemporize. Do you know, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
think there&rsquo;s a hidden lesson in that story that would
do some of those boys and girls good if they could see
it lived out, and perhaps set them to reading the book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again they would be asked suddenly, soon after
their arrival, each one to represent his favorite character
in Shakespeare, or to reproduce some great public
man so that they all could recognize him; and they
would be sent up-stairs to select from a great pile of
shawls, wraps, and all sorts of garments any which
they needed for an improvised costume.</p>
<p>Another evening there would be brought forth a
new game which nobody had seen, and which absorbed
them all for perhaps two hours until some delicious and
unique refreshments would be produced to conclude the
festivities. At another time the round dining-table
would be stretched to take in all its leaves, and the entire
company would gather around it with uplifted
thumbs and eager faces unroariously playing &ldquo;up
Jenkins&rdquo; for an hour or two. Any little old game
went well under that roof, though Julia Cloud kept
a controlling mind on things, and always managed
to change the game before anybody was weary of it.</p>
<p>Also there was much music in the little house.
Allison played the violin well; two or three others who
played a little at stringed and wind instruments were
discovered; and often the whole company would break
loose into song until people on the street halted and
walked back and forth in front of the house to listen
to the wild, sweet harmonies of the fresh young voices.</p>
<p>At the close of such an evening it was not an
uncommon happening for a crowd of the frat boys to
gather in a knot in front of the house and give the
college yell, with a tiger at the end, and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
&ldquo;CLOUD! CLOUD! CLOUD!&rdquo; The people living
on that street got used to it, and opened their windows
to listen, with eyes tender and thoughtful as they pondered
on how easily this little family had caught the
hearts of those college people, and were helping them
to have a good time. Perhaps it entered into their
minds that other people might do the same thing if they
would only half try.</p>
<p>In return for all her kindness a number of the
young people would often respond to Julia Cloud&rsquo;s
wistful invitation to go to church, and more and more
they were being drawn by twos and threes to come to
the Christian Endeavor meetings in the village. It
seemed as if they had but just discovered that there
was such a thing, to the equal amazement of themselves
and the original members of the Christian Endeavor
Society, who had always responded to any such
suggestions on the part of their pastor or elders with a
hopeless &ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t get those college guys to do
anything! They think they&rsquo;re it!&rdquo; The feeling was
gradually melting away, and a new brotherhood and
sisterhood was springing up between them. It was
not infrequent now for a college maiden to greet some
village girl with a frank, pleasant smile, and accept invitations
to lunch and dinner. And college boys were
friendly and chummy with the village boys who were
not fellow-students, and often took them up to their
frat rooms to visit. So the two elements of the locality
were coming nearer to each other, and their bond was
the village Christian Endeavor Society.</p>
<p>So passed the first winter and spring in the little
pink-and-white house. And with the first week of
vacation there came visitors.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXIV' id='CHAPTER_XXIV'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guardy Lud&rdquo; was the first visitor, just for
a night and a day. He had come East for
a flying business trip, and could not pass
by his beloved wards without at least a glimpse. He
dropped down into their midst quite unexpectedly the
night before college closed, and found them with a
bevy of young people at the supper-table, who opened
their ranks right heartily, and took him in. He sat
on the terrace in the moonlight with them afterwards,
joking, telling them stories, and eating chocolates
with the rest. When they gathered about the piano
for a sing, he joined in with a good old tenor, surprising
them all by knowing a lot of the songs they sang.</p>
<p>After the young people were gone he lingered, wiping
his eyes, and saying, &ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; thoughtfully.
He told Julia Cloud over and over again how
more than pleased he was with what she had done for
his children, and insisted that her salary should be
twice as large. He told her she was a big success, and
should have more money at her command to do with
as she pleased, and that he wanted the children to have
a larger allowance during the coming year. Allison
had spoken of his work among the young people of
the church, and he felt that it would have been the
wish of their father and mother both that the young
people should give liberally toward church-work. He
would see that a sum was set aside in the bank for their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
use in any such plans as they might have for their Christian
Endeavor work.</p>
<p>They talked far into the night, for he had to hear
all the stories of all their doings, and every minute or
two one or the other of the children would break in to
tell something about the other or to praise their dear
Cloudy Jewel for her part in everything.</p>
<p>The next day they took him everywhere and showed
him everything about the college and the place, introduced
him to their favorite professors, at least those
who were not already gone on their vacations, and
took him for a long drive past their favorite haunts.
Then he had to meet Jane Bristol and Howard
Letchworth. Julia Cloud was greatly relieved and
delighted when he set his approval upon both these
young people as suitable friends for the children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are both poor and earning their own living,&rdquo;
said Julia Cloud, feeling that in view of the future and
what it might contain she wanted to be entirely honest,
that the weight of responsibility should not rest too
heavily upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the better for that, no doubt,&rdquo; said Guardy
Lud thoughtfully, watching Jane Bristol&rsquo;s sweet smile
as she talked over some committee plans with Allison.
&ldquo;I should say they were about as wholesome a couple
of young people as could be found to match your two.
Just keep &rsquo;em to that kind for a year or two more, and
they&rsquo;ll choose that kind for life. I&rsquo;m entirely satisfied
with the work you&rsquo;re doing, Miss Cloud. I couldn&rsquo;t
have found a better mother for &rsquo;em if I&rsquo;d searched
heaven, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so Julia Cloud was well content to go on with
her beloved work as home-maker.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></div>
<p>But the day after Guardy Lud left, just as the three
were sitting together over a great State map of roads,
perfecting their plans for a wonderful vacation, which
was to include a brief visit to Ellen Robinson at Sterling,
a noisy Ford drew up at the door, and there was
Ellen Robinson herself, with the entire family done
up in linen dust-coats and peering curiously, half contemptuously,
at the strange pink-and-white architecture
of the many-windowed &ldquo;villa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison arose and went down the terrace to do the
honors, showing his uncle where to drive in and put
his car in the little garage, helping his aunt and the
little cousins to alight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake, Julia, what a queer house
you&rsquo;ve got!&rdquo; said Ellen the minute she arrived, gazing
disapprovingly at the many windows and the brick terrace.
&ldquo;I should think &rsquo;twould take all your time to
keep clean. What&rsquo;s the idea in making a sidewalk of
your front porch? Looks as if some crazy person had
built it. Couldn&rsquo;t you find anything better than this
in the town? I saw some real pretty frame houses
with gardens as we came through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We like this very well,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud with
her old patient smile and the hurt flush that always
accompanied her answers to her sister&rsquo;s contempt.
&ldquo;Cherry doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind washing windows. She
likes to keep them bright. We find it very comfortable
and light and airy. Come inside, and see how pretty
it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once inside, Ellen Robinson was somewhat awed
with the strangeness of the rooms and the beauty of
the furnishings, but all she said after a prolonged
survey was: &ldquo;Um! No paper on the wall! That&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
queer, isn&rsquo;t it? And the chimney right in the room!
It looks as though they didn&rsquo;t have plaster enough to
go around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie took the children up-stairs to wash their
faces and freshen up, and Julia Cloud led her sister to
the lovely guest-room that was always in perfect order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you certainly have things well fixed,&rdquo; said
Ellen grudgingly. &ldquo;What easy little stairs! It&rsquo;s like
child&rsquo;s play going up. I suppose that&rsquo;s one consolation
for having such a little playhouse affair to live in;
you don&rsquo;t have to climb up far. Well, we&rsquo;ve come to
stay two days if you want us. Herbert said he could
spare that much time off, and we&rsquo;re going to stop in
Thayerville on the way back and see his folks a couple
of days; and that&rsquo;ll be a week. Now, if you don&rsquo;t
want us, say so, and we&rsquo;ll go on to-night. It isn&rsquo;t as if
we couldn&rsquo;t go when we like, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Julia Cloud was genuinely glad to see her
sister, and said so heartily enough to satisfy even so
jealous a nature as Ellen&rsquo;s; and so presently they were
walking about the pretty rooms together, and Ellen
was taking in all the beauties of the home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is your bedroom!&rdquo; she paused in the
middle of the rose-and-gray room, and looked about
her, taking in every little detail with an eye that would
put it away for remembrance long afterwards. &ldquo;Well,
they certainly have feathered your nest well!&rdquo; she
declared as her eyes rested on the luxury everywhere.
&ldquo;Though I don&rsquo;t like that painted furniture much
myself,&rdquo; she said as she glanced at the French gray
enamel of the bed; &ldquo;but I suppose it&rsquo;s all right if that&rsquo;s
the kind of thing you like. Was it some of their old
furniture from California?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud quickly, the pretty
flush coming in her cheeks. &ldquo;Everything was bought
new except a few little bits of mahogany down-stairs.
We had such fun choosing it, too. Don&rsquo;t you like
my furniture? I love it. I hovered around it again
and again; but I didn&rsquo;t dream of having it in my room,
it was so expensive. It&rsquo;s real French enamel, you
know, and happens to be a craze of fashion at present.
I thought it was ridiculous to buy it, but Leslie insisted
that it was the only thing for my room; and
those crazy, extravagant children went and bought it
when I had my head turned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; said Ellen Robinson, putting a
hard, investigating finger on the foot-board. &ldquo;Well, it
does seem sort of smooth. But I never thought my
cane-seat chairs were much. Guess I&rsquo;ll have to get &rsquo;em
out and varnish &rsquo;em. What&rsquo;s that out there, a porch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud led her out to the upper porch with
its rush rugs, willow chairs, and table, and its stone
wall crowned with blooming plants and trailing vines.
She showed her the bird&rsquo;s nest in the tree overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ellen half sourly, &ldquo;I suppose there&rsquo;s
no chance of your getting sick of it all and coming
back, and I must say I don&rsquo;t blame you. It certainly
is a contrast from the way you&rsquo;ve lived up to now.
But these children will grow up and get married, and
then where will you be? I suppose you have chances
here of getting married, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The color flamed into Julia Cloud&rsquo;s cheeks in good
earnest now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not looking for such chances, Ellen,&rdquo; she said
decidedly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend ever to marry. I&rsquo;m happier
as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but after these children are married what&rsquo;ll
you do? Who&rsquo;ll support you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that worry you, Ellen, There are other
children, and I love to mother them. But as far as
support is concerned I&rsquo;m putting away money in the
bank constantly, more than I ever expected to have
all together in life; and I shall not trouble anybody
for support. However, I hope to be able to work for
a good many years yet, and what I&rsquo;m doing now I love.
Shall we go down-stairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have Allison and Leslie got any sweethearts
yet?&rdquo; she asked pryingly as she followed her sister
down the stairs. &ldquo;I suppose they have by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have a great many young friends, and we
have beautiful times together. But you won&rsquo;t see
many of them now. College closed last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For two long days Allison and Leslie devoted themselves
religiously to their relatives, taking them here
and there in the car, showing them over the college and
the town, and trying in all the ways they knew to
make them have a good time; but when at last the two
days and two nights were over, and the Robinsons had
piled into their car and started away with grudging
thanks for the efforts in their behalf, Leslie sat on the
terrace musingly; and at last quite shyly she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloudy, dear, what makes such a difference in
people? Why are some so much harder to make have
a good time than others? Why, I feel as if I&rsquo;d lived
years since day before yesterday, and I don&rsquo;t feel as
if they&rsquo;d half enjoyed anything. I really wanted to
make them happy, for I felt as if we&rsquo;d taken so much
from them when we took you; but I just seemed to fail,
everything I did.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></div>
<p>Julia Cloud smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is, dear, unless it is that
some people have different ideals and standards from
other people, and they can&rsquo;t find their pleasure the same
way. Your Aunt Ellen always wanted to have a lot
of people around, and liked to go to tea-parties and
dress a great deal; and she never cared for reading or
study or music. But I think you&rsquo;re mistaken about
their not having had a good time. They appreciated
your trying to do things for them, I know, for Aunt
Ellen said to me that you were a very thoughtful girl.
And the children enjoyed the victrola, especially the
funny records. Herbert liked it that Allison let him
drive his car when they went out. They enjoyed the
eating, too, I know, even though Ellen did say she
shouldn&rsquo;t care to have her meals cooked by a servant;
she should want to be <i>sure</i> they were clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she truly say that, Cloudy?&rdquo; twinkled Leslie.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she funny?&rdquo; They both broke down
and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m glad they came, Cloudy. I truly am. It
was nice to play with the children, and nice to have a
home to show our relatives, and nicest of all to have
them see you&ndash;&ndash;how beautiful you are at the head of
the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, flattering child!&rdquo; said Julia Cloud lovingly.
&ldquo;It is so good to know you feel that way! But now
here comes Allison, and we must finish up our plans
for the trip and get ready to close the house for
the summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had a wonderful trip to mountains and lakes
and seaside, staying as long as they pleased wherever
they liked, and everywhere making friends and having
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
good times; but toward the end of their trip the children
began to get restless for the little pink-and-white
cottage and home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We really ought to get back and see how the
Christian Endeavor Society is getting along,&rdquo; said
Allison one day as they glided through a little village
that reminded them of home. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any place
as nice as our town, do you, Cloudy? And I don&rsquo;t feel
quite right anywhere but home on Sunday, do you?
For, really, all the Christian Endeavor societies I&rsquo;ve
been to this summer acted as if their members were all
away on vacations and they didn&rsquo;t care whether school
kept or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they went home to begin another happy
winter. But the very first day there came a rift in
their happiness in the shape of the new professor of
chemistry, a man about Julia Cloud&rsquo;s age, whom Ellen
Robinson had met on her visit to Thayerville, and told
about her sister. Ellen had suggested that maybe he
could get her sister to take him to board!</p>
<p>To this day Julia Cloud has never decided whether
Ellen really thought Julia would take a professor from
the college to board, or whether she just sent him there
as a joke. There was a third solution, which Julia
Cloud kept in the back of her mind and only took out
occasionally with an angry, troubled look when she was
very much annoyed. It was that Ellen was still anxious
to have her sister get married, and she had taken this
way to get her acquainted with a man whom she thought
a &ldquo;good match&rdquo;. If Julia had been sure that this idea
had entered into her sister&rsquo;s thoughts, she might have
slammed the door in Professor Armitage&rsquo;s face that
night when he had the audacity to come and ask to be
taken into Cloudy Villa as a boarder.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the very idea!&rdquo; said Leslie with snapping
eyes. &ldquo;As if we wanted a <i>man</i> always around! No,
indeed! <i>Horrors!</i> Wouldn&rsquo;t that be <i>awful</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Professor Armitage, like everybody else who
came once to Cloudy Villa, liked it, and begged a thousand
pardons for presuming, but came again and again,
until even the children began to like him in a way, and
did not in the least mind having him around.</p>
<p>But the day came at last, about the middle of the
winter, or nearer to the spring, when Leslie and Allison
began to realize that Professor Armitage came to see
their Cloudy Jewel, and they met in solemn conclave to
talk it over.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>
<p>It was out on a lonely road in the car that they
had chosen to go for their conference, where
there was no chance of their being interrupted;
and they whirled away through the town and out to
the long stretch of whiteness in glum silence, the tears
welling to overflow in Leslie&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>At last they were past the bounds where they were
likely to meet acquaintances, and Leslie broke forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think it&rsquo;s true that we&rsquo;ve got to
give her up? Are you sure it has come to that, Allison?
It seems perfectly preposterous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know if she cares for him,&rdquo; said Allison
gravely, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve no right to hold on to her and spoil
her life. You know it was different when it was old
Pill Bowman. This is a real man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Care for him! How <i>could</i> she possibly care for
him?&rdquo; snapped Leslie. &ldquo;Why, he has a wart on his
nose, and he snuffs! I never thought of it before till
last night, but he does; he snuffs every little
while! Ugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought you liked him, Leslie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did until I thought he wanted Cloudy, but I
can&rsquo;t see that! I hate him. I always thought he was
about the nicest man in the faculty except the dean, and
he&rsquo;s married; but since I got onto the idea that he
wants Cloudy I can&rsquo;t bear the sight of him. I went way
round the block to-day to keep from meeting him. He
isn&rsquo;t nice enough for Cloudy, Allison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him? Warts and snuffing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
don&rsquo;t count if you love a person. I like him. I
like him ever so much, and I think he&rsquo;s lonesome.
He&rsquo;d appreciate a home like ours. You know what a
wonderful wife Cloudy would make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie fairly screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Allison! To think you have come to it that
you&rsquo;re <i>willing</i> to give up our lovely home, and have
Cloudy go off, and we go the dear knows where, and
have to board at the college or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day we&rsquo;ll be getting married, too, I suppose,&rdquo;
said Allison speculatively.</p>
<p>His sister flashed a wise, curious look up at him,
and studied his face a minute. Then a shade came over
her own once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I s&rsquo;pose <i>you</i> will, pretty soon. You&rsquo;re almost
done college. But poor me! I&rsquo;ll have to board for two
whole years more, and I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll ever get married.
The man I like might not like me. And you may
be very sure I&rsquo;m not going to live on any sister-in-law,
no matter how much I love her, so there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison smiled, and put his arm protectingly around
his sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, kid, you needn&rsquo;t get excited yet awhile.
It&rsquo;s me and thee always, no matter how many wives I
have; and you won&rsquo;t ever have to board. But, kid, I&rsquo;m
not willing to give up our house and Cloudy and all;
I&rsquo;m just thinking that maybe we <i>ought</i> to, you know.
I guess we&rsquo;re not pigs, are we? Cloudy has had a
mighty hard life, and missed a lot of things out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t she having &rsquo;em now, I&rsquo;d like to know?
I think Cloudy likes us, and wants to stay with us. I
think she&rsquo;s just loved the house and everything
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so, too; but this is something bigger
than anything else in the world if she really cares.
Don&rsquo;t you think we ought to give her the chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose so, if she really wants it; but how can
we find out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it; just give her the chance. When
Armitage comes in, just sneak out and stay away, and
let her have a little time alone with him. It isn&rsquo;t right,
us kids always sticking around. We ought to go out
or up-stairs or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie was still for a long time; and then she heaved
a big sigh, and said, &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; in a very small voice.
As they sped on their way toward home, there was
hardly a word more between them.</p>
<p>It was after supper that very night that Leslie,
having almost frightened Julia Cloud out of her happy
calm by refusing to eat much supper, went off to bed
with a headache as soon as the professor came in.
Allison, too, said he had to go up to the college for a
book he had forgotten; and for the first time since his
advent the professor had a clear evening ahead of him
with Julia Cloud, without anybody else by.</p>
<p>But Julia Cloud was distraught, and gave him little
attention at first, with an attitude of listening directed
toward the floor above. Finally she gently excused
herself for a moment, and hurried up to Leslie&rsquo;s room,
where she found a very damp and tearful Leslie attempting
to appear wonderfully calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, dear child? Has something happened?&rdquo;
she begged. &ldquo;I know you must be sick, or
you wouldn&rsquo;t have gone to bed so early. Please tell
me what is the matter. I shall send for the doctor
at once if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></div>
<p>Then Leslie, knowing that her brother would blame
her if she spoiled the test, sat up bravely, and tried to
laugh, assuring her aunt that she was only tired from
studying and a little stiff from playing hockey too long,
and she thought it would be better to rest to-night so
she could be all right in the morning.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud, only half reassured by this unprecedented
carefulness for her health on the part of the
usually careless Leslie, went down abstractedly to her
professor, and wished he would go home. He was
well into the midst of a most heartfelt and touching proposal
of marriage before she realized what was coming.</p>
<p>His voice was low and pleading; and Leslie, lying
breathless above, not deigning to try to listen, yet
painfully aware of the change of tones, was in tortures.
Then Julia Cloud&rsquo;s pained, gentle tones, firmly
replying, and more entreaty, with brief, simple answers.
Most unexpectedly, before an hour passed Leslie heard
the front door open and the professor go out and pass
slowly down the walk. Her heart was in her throat,
beating painfully. What had happened? A quick intuition
presented a possible solution. Cloudy would
not leave them while they were in college, and had
bid him wait, or perhaps turned him down altogether!
How dear of her! And yet with quick revulsion of
spirit she began to pity the poor, lonely man who could
not have Cloudy when he loved her.</p>
<p>A moment later Julia Cloud came softly up the
stairs and tiptoed into her own room, and, horror of
horrors! Leslie could hear her catch her breath like
soft sobbing! Did Cloudy care, then, and had she
turned down a man she loved in order to stick to them
and keep her promise to their guardian?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></div>
<p>Quick as a flash she was out of bed and pattering
barefoot into Julia Cloud&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloudy! Cloudy! You are crying! What is the
matter? Quick! Tell me, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud drew the girl down beside her on the
bed, and nestled her lovingly and close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, dear. It&rsquo;s only that I had to hurt
a good man. It always makes me sorry to have to hurt
any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie nestled closer, smoothed her aunt&rsquo;s hair, and
tried to think what to say; but nothing came. She felt
shy about it. Finally she put her lips up, and touched
her aunt&rsquo;s cheek, and whispered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, Cloudy
dear!&rdquo; and just then she heard Allison&rsquo;s key in the lock.
She sprang up, drew her bath-robe about her, and
ran down to whisper to him on the stairs what
had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s plain she cares,&rdquo; whispered Allison
sadly, gravely, turning his face away from the light.
&ldquo;I say, Les, we ought to do something. We ought
to tell her it&rsquo;s all right for her to go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, Allison; I&rsquo;d break down and cry, I know
I would. I tried up there just now, but the words
wouldn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, let&rsquo;s write her a letter! And we&rsquo;ll
both sign it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. You write it,&rdquo; choked Leslie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
sign it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They slipped over to the desk in the porch room, and
Leslie cuddled into a big willow cushioned chair, and
shivered and sniffed while Allison scratched away at a
sheet of paper for a few minutes. Then he handed it to
her to read and sign. This was what he had written:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Dear Cloudy</span>: We see just how it is, and we
want you to know that we are willing. Of course it&rsquo;ll
be awfully hard to lose you; but it&rsquo;s right, and we
wouldn&rsquo;t be happy not to have you be happy; and we
want you to go ahead and not think of us. We&rsquo;ll manage
all right somehow, and we love you and want to see
you happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie dropped a great tear on the page when she
signed it; but she took the soft, embroidered sleeve of
her nightgown, and dabbled it dry, so that it didn&rsquo;t
blur the writing; and then together they slipped up-stairs.
Leslie went into her aunt&rsquo;s room in the dark,
and in a queer little voice said, &ldquo;Cloudy, dear, here&rsquo;s
a note for you.&rdquo; Laying it in her hand, Leslie hurried
into her own room, shut her door softly, and hid in
the closet so that Julia Cloud would not hear her sob.</p>
<p>A moment later Julia Cloud came into the hall with
a dear, glad ring in her voice, and called: &ldquo;Children!
Where are you? Come here quick, you darlings!&rdquo;
and they flocked into her arms like lost ducklings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You blessed darlings!&rdquo; she said, laughing and
crying at the same time. &ldquo;Did you think I wanted to
get married and go away from you forever? Well,
you&rsquo;re all wrong. I&rsquo;ll never do that. You may get
married and go away from me; but I&rsquo;ll never go away
from you till you send me, and I won&rsquo;t ever get married
to any one on this earth at any time! Do you understand?
I don&rsquo;t want to get married, <i>ever</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all went into Julia Cloud&rsquo;s room then, and sat
down with her on her couch, one on either side of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really mean it, Cloudy Jewel?&rdquo; asked
Leslie happily. &ldquo;You <i>don&rsquo;t want</i> to get married, not
even to that nice Professor Armitage?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here! Leslie, you said he had a wart!&rdquo;
put in her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now keep still, Allison. He was nice all the
time; only I didn&rsquo;t like him to want our Cloudy. He
didn&rsquo;t seem to be quite nice enough for her. He didn&rsquo;t
quite fit her. But if she wanted him&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t, Leslie,&rdquo; cried Julia Cloud in distress.
&ldquo;I <i>never</i> did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you really true, Cloudy, dear? You&rsquo;re such
a dear, unselfish Cloudy. How shall we ever quite be
sure she isn&rsquo;t giving him up just for us, Allison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Children, listen!&rdquo; said Julia Cloud, suddenly putting
a quieting hand on each young hand in her lap.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something I never told to a living soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was that in her voice that thrilled them into
silence. It was as if she suddenly opened the door
of her soul and let them look in on her real self as only
God saw her. Their fingers tightened in sympathy as
she went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A long time ago&ndash;&ndash;a great many years ago&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
you would laugh and think me foolish if you
knew how many&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Cloudy, never!&rdquo; said Leslie softly; and
Allison growled a dissenting note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;there was some one whom I loved&ndash;&ndash;who
died. That is all; only&ndash;&ndash;I never could love anybody
that way again. Marriage without a love like that is
a desecration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Cloudy! We never knew&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; murmured
Leslie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one ever knew, dear. He was very young.
We were both scarcely more than children. I was
only fourteen&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;O Cloudy! How beautiful! And you have kept
it all these years! Won&rsquo;t you&ndash;&ndash;tell us just a little about
it? I think it is wonderful; don&rsquo;t you, Allison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, wonderful!&rdquo; said Allison in that deep, full
tone of his that revealed a man&rsquo;s soul growing in the
boy&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is very little to tell, dear. He was a
neighbor&rsquo;s son. We went to school together, and sometimes
took walks on Saturdays. He rode me on his
sled, and helped me fasten on my skates, and carried
my books; and we played together when we had time
to play. Then his people moved away out West; and
he kissed me good-by, and told me he was coming back
for me some day. That was all there was to it except
a few little letters. Then they stopped, and one day
his grandmother wrote that he had been drowned saving
the life of a little child. Can you understand why
I want to wait and be ready for him over there where he
is gone? I keep feeling God will let him come for me
when my life down here is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a long silence during which the young
hands gripped hers closely, and the young thoughts
grew strangely wise with insight into human life and
all its joys and sorrows. They were thinking out in
detail just what their aunt had missed, the sweet things
that every woman hopes for, and thinks about alone
with God; of love, strong care, little children, and a
home. She had missed it all; and yet she had its image
in her heart, and had been true to her first thought of
it all the years. Now, when it was offered her again, she
would not give up the old love for a new, would not
take what was left of life. She would wait till the
morning broke and her boy met her on the other shore.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></div>
<p>Suddenly, as they thought, strong young arms encircled
her, and held her close in a dear embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re ours, Cloudy, all ours, for the rest of
down here, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; half whispered Leslie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, as long as you need me&ndash;&ndash;<i>want</i> me,&rdquo;
she finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall want you always, Cloudy!&rdquo; said Allison
in a clear man&rsquo;s voice of decision. &ldquo;Put that down
forever, Cloudy Jewel. You are our mother from now
on and we want you always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is dear,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud; &ldquo;but&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;a resignation
in her voice&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;some day you will marry, and
then you will not need me any more and I shall find
something to do somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two fierce young things rose up in arms at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put that right out of your head, Cloudy Jewel!&rdquo;
cried Leslie. &ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t say it again! If I thought
any man could be mean enough not to feel as I do about
you, I would never marry him; so there! I would
never marry anybody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife will love you as much as I do!&rdquo; said
Allison with conviction. &ldquo;I shall never love anybody
that doesn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so with loving arms about her and tender
words of fierce assertion they convinced her at last,
and the bond that held them was only strengthened by
the little tension it had sustained.</p>
<p>Professor Armitage came no more to the little
pink-and-white house; but Julia Cloud was happy with
her children, and they were content together. The
happy days moved on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you get time for that Christian
Endeavor Society of yours, Cloud,&rdquo; said one of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
professors to Allison. &ldquo;I hear you&rsquo;re the moving
spirit in it; yet you never fall down on your class
work. How do you manage it? I&rsquo;d like to put some
of my other students onto your ways of planning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s all of Sunday, you know, professor,&rdquo;
answered Allison promptly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give so
very much more time, except a half-hour here and
there to a committee meeting, or now and then a social
on Friday night, when I&rsquo;d otherwise be fooling, anyway.
My sister and I cut out the dances, and put these
social parties in their place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you have to study on Sundays?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Never</i> do!&rdquo; was the quick reply. &ldquo;Made it a
rule when I started in here at this college, and haven&rsquo;t
broken it once, not even for examinations. I find I&rsquo;m
fresher for my work Monday morning when I make
the Sabbath <i>real.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The professor eyed him curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that certainly is interesting,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
have to try it. Though I don&rsquo;t see how I&rsquo;d quite manage
it. I usually have to spend the whole Sunday
correcting papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save &rsquo;em up till early Monday morning, and come
over to our Christian Endeavor meeting. See if it
isn&rsquo;t worth while, and then see how much more you
can do Monday morning at five o&rsquo;clock, when you&rsquo;re
really rested, than you could all day Sunday hacking
at the same old job you&rsquo;ve had all the week. I&rsquo;ll look
for you next Sunday night. So-long!&rdquo; And with a
courteous wave he was off with a lacrosse stick, gliding
down the campus like a wild thing. The professor
stood and watched him a moment, and then turned
thoughtfully up the asphalt path, pondering.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;They are a power in the college and in the community,
that sister and brother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wonder
why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down at the church they wondered also as they
came in crowds to the live Christian Endeavor meetings,
and listened to the clear, ringing words of the
young man who had been president before him; as they
praises sounded by his admiring friends, especially the
young man who had been president before him; as they
saw the earnest spirit that went out to save, and had
no social distinctions or classes to hinder the fraternal
interest. The pastor wondered most of all, and thanked
God, and told his wife that that Endeavor Society was
making his church all over. He didn&rsquo;t know but it had
converted him again, too. The session wondered as it
listened to the earnest, simple gospel sermons that the
pastor now preached, and saw his zeal for bringing men
to the service of Christ.</p>
<p>Oh, they pointed out the four young people, the
Clouds, Jane Bristol, and Howard Letchworth, as the
moving spirits in the work; and they admitted, some
of them, that prayer had made the transformation, for
there were not many of the original bunch of young
people who by this time had not been fully trained to
understand that if you wanted anything in the spiritual
world you must take time and give energy to getting
acquainted with God. But, if they could have gone
with some spirit guide to find out the true secret of all
the wonderful spiritual growth and power of that young
people&rsquo;s society, they must have looked in about Julia
Cloud&rsquo;s fireplace on Sabbath afternoon, and seen the
four earnest young people with their Bibles, and Julia
Cloud in the midst, spending the long, beautiful hours
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
in actual spiritual study of God&rsquo;s word, and then kneeling
and communing with God for a little while, all of
them on intimate terms with God. They were actually
learning to delight themselves in the Lord. It was no
wonder that other people, even outside the church and
the Christian Endeavor Society, were beginning to
notice the difference in the four, just as they noticed
the shining of Moses&rsquo;s face when he came down from
the mountain after communing with God.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud stood at the window of her rose-and-gray
room one Sabbath evening after such an afternoon,
watching the four children walk out into the
sunset to their Christian Endeavor meeting, and smiled
with a tender light in her eyes. She had come to call
them her <i>four</i> children in her heart now, for they all
seemed to love and need her alike; and for many a
month, though they seemed not yet openly aware of it,
they had been growing more and more all in all to one
another; and she was glad.</p>
<p>She watched them as they walked. Allison ahead
with Jane, earnestly discussing something. Jane&rsquo;s
sweet, serious eyes looking up so trustfully to Allison,
and he so tall and fine beside her; Leslie tripping along
like a bird behind with Howard, and pointing out the
colors in the sunset, which he watched only as they were
reflected in her eyes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
</div>
<p>Howard Letchworth settled himself
comfortably by an open window in the 5.12
express and spread out the evening paper,
turning, like any true college man, first to the sporting
page. He was anxious to know how his team had
come out in the season&rsquo;s greatest contest with another
larger college. He had hoped to be there to witness
the game himself, and in fact the Clouds had invited
him to go with them in their car, but unfortunately
at the last minute a telegram came from a firm with
whom he expected to be located during the summer,
saying that their representative would be in the city
that afternoon and would like to see him. Howard had
been obliged to give up the day&rsquo;s pleasure and see his
friends start off without him. Now, his business over,
he was returning to college and having his first minute
of leisure to see how the game came out.</p>
<p>The train was crowded, for it was just at closing
time and every one was in a rush to get home. Engrossed
in his paper, he noticed none of them until
someone dropped, or rather sprawled, in the seat beside
him, taking far more room than was really
necessary, and making a lot of fuss pulling up his
trousers and getting his patent leather feet adjusted
to suit him around a very handsome sole-leather suitcase
which he crowded unceremoniously over to
Howard&rsquo;s side of the floor.</p>
<p>The intruder next addressed himself to the arrangement
of a rich and striking necktie, and seemed to have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
no compunctions about annoying his neighbor during
the process. Howard glanced up in surprise as a more
strenuous knock than before jarred his paper out of
focus. He saw a young fellow of about his own age
with a face that would have been strikingly handsome
if it had not also been bold and conceited. He had
large dark eyes set off by long curling black lashes,
black hair that crinkled close to his head in satiny
sleek sheen, well-chiselled features, all save a loose-hung,
insolent lip that gave the impression of great
self-indulgence and selfishness. He was dressed with
a careful regard to the fashion and with evidently no
regard whatever for cost. He bore the mark at once
of wealth and snobbishness. Howard, in spite of his
newly-acquired desire to look upon all men as brothers,
found himself disliking him with a vehemence that
was out of all proportion to the occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they have any pahlah cars on this road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was addressed to him in a calm, insolent
tone as if he were a paid servitor of the road.
He looked up amusedly and eyed the stranger pitingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so as you&rsquo;d notice it,&rdquo; he remarked crushingly
as he turned back to his paper. &ldquo;People on this
road too busy to use &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the stranger did not crush easily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Live far out?&rdquo; he asked, turning his big, bold
eyes on his seatmate and calmly examining him from
the toe of a well-worn shoe to the crown of a dusty
old hat that Howard was trying to make last till the
end of the season. When he had finished the survey
his eyes travelled complacently back to his own immaculate
attire, and his well-polished shoes fresh from
the hands of the city station bootblack. With a well-manicured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
thumb and finger he flecked an imaginary bit
of dust from the knee of his trousers.</p>
<p>Howard named the college town brusquely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, indeed!&rdquo; Another survey brief and significant
this time. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you know any people
at the college.&rdquo; It was scarcely a question, more like
a statement of a deplorable fact. Howard was suddenly
amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a few,&rdquo; he said briefly. (He was just
finishing his senior year rather brilliantly and his professors
were more than proud of him.)</p>
<p>Another glance seemed to say: &ldquo;In what capacity?&rdquo;
but the elegant youth finally decided to voice
another question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t happen to know a fellah by the name of
Cloud, I suppose? Al Cloud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met him,&rdquo; said Howard with his eyes still
on his paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s from my State!&rdquo; announced the youth with
a puff of importance. &ldquo;We live next door in California.
He&rsquo;s a regular guy, he is. Got all kinds of
money coming to him. He&rsquo;ll be of age in a month or
two now, and then you&rsquo;ll see him start something! He&rsquo;s
some spender, <i>he</i> is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Howard made no comment, but something in him
revolted at the idea of talking over his friend in
such company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to hunt him up,&rdquo; went on the young
man, not noticing that his auditor appeared uninterested.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m to stay with him to-night. I was to
send a telegram, but didn&rsquo;t think of it till it was almost
train time. Guess it won&rsquo;t make much difference.
The Clouds always used to keep open house. I suppose
they have a swell place out here?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s quite comfortable, I believe,&rdquo; Howard
turned over a page of the paper and fell to reading an
article on the high price of sugar and the prospect
of a fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to see their dump out in Cally. It&rsquo;s
some mansion, believe me! There wasn&rsquo;t anything else
in that part of the State to compare with it for miles
around. And cahs! They had cahs to burn! The
old man was just lousy with gold, you know; struck a
rich mine years ago. His wife had a pile, too. Her
father was all kinds of a millionaire and left every
bit to her; and Al and his sister&rsquo;ll get everything.
Seen anything of <i>her</i>? She ought to be a winner pretty
soon. She was a peach when she was little. She&rsquo;s
some speedy kid! We used to play together, you know,
and our folks sorta fixed it up we were just made for
each other and all that sorta thing, you know&ndash;&ndash;but
I don&rsquo;t know&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m not going to be bound by any such
nonsense, of course, unless I like. One doesn&rsquo;t want
one&rsquo;s wife to be such an awfully good shot, fer instance,
you know&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great anger surged up in Howard&rsquo;s soul, and his
jaw set with a fierce line that those who knew him
well had learned to understand meant self-control
under deep provocation. He would have liked nothing
better than to surprise the insolent young snob
with a well-directed blow in his pretty face that would
have sent him sprawling in the aisle. His hands fairly
twitched to give him the lesson that he needed, but he
only replied with a slight inscrutable smile in one
corner of his mouth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>might</i> be inconvenient for <i>some people</i>.&rdquo; There
an aloofness in his tone that did not encourage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
further remarks, but the young stranger was evidently
not thin-skinned, or else he loved to hear himself
babbling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming on heah, you know, to look this college
ovah&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;If it suits me, I may come
heah next yeah. Got fired from three institutions out
West for larking, and father thought I better go East
awhile. Any fun doing out this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose those that go to college looking for it
can find it,&rdquo; answered Howard noncommittally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m looking for. That&rsquo;s about
all anybody goes to college for anyway, that and making
a lot of friends. Believe me, it would be a beastly
bore if it wasn&rsquo;t for that. Al Cloud used to be a lively
one. I&rsquo;ll wager he&rsquo;s into everything. See much of the
college people down in town&ndash;&ndash;do you?&rdquo; He eyed his
companion patronizingly. &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose you get in on some
of the spoahts now and then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, occasionally,&rdquo; said Howard with a twinkle
in his eye. He was captain of the football team and
forward in basket-ball, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to be necessary
to mention it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any fellows with any pep in them out here? I
suppose there must be or Al wouldn&rsquo;t stay unless he&rsquo;s
changed. He used to keep things pretty lively. That&rsquo;s
one reason why I told dad I&rsquo;d come out here. I like
a place with plenty of ginger. It gets my goat to be
among a lot of grinds and sissies! This is a co-ed
college, isn&rsquo;t it? That suits me all right if the girls
have any pep and aren&rsquo;t too straitlaced. Any place
around here where you can go off and take a girl for a
good dinner and a dash of life? I couldn&rsquo;t stand for
any good-little-boy stuff. Know any place around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
here where you can get a drink of the real thing now
and then, some place near enough to go joy-riding to,
you know? I shall bring my cah of course&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;! One
can get away with a lot more stuff if they have their
own cah, you know&ndash;&ndash;especially where there&rsquo;s girls.
You can&rsquo;t pull off any devilment if you have to depend
on hired cahs. You might get caught. I suppose
they have some pretty spicy times down at the frat
rooms, don&rsquo;t they? I understood the frats were mostly
located down in the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Howard suddenly folded his paper, looking squarely
in the limpid eyes of his seatmate for the first time,
with a cold, searching, subduing gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really couldn&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; he answered coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;re not interested in that sort of
thing, not being in college,&rdquo; said the other insolently.
&ldquo;But Al Cloud&rsquo;ll put me wise. He&rsquo;s no grind, I&rsquo;ll
wager. He&rsquo;s always in for a good time, and he&rsquo;s such a
good bluff he never gets found out. Now I, somehow,
always get caught, even when I&rsquo;m not the guilty one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy laughed unroariously as if it were a good
joke, and his weak chin seemed to grow weaker in
the process.</p>
<p>Howard was growing angry and haughty, but it
was his way to be calm when excited. He did not laugh
with the stranger. Instead, he waited until the joke
had lost its amusement and then he turned soberly to
the youth with as patronizing an air as ever the other
had worn:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son, you&rsquo;ve got another guess coming to you
about Allison Cloud. You&rsquo;ll have the surprise of your
young life when you see him, I imagine. Why, he&rsquo;s
been an A student ever since he came to this college,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
and he has the highest average this last semester of any
man in his class. As for bluff, he&rsquo;s as clear as crystal,
and a prince of a fellow; and if you&rsquo;re looking for a
spot where you can bluff your way through college you
better seek elsewhere. Bluff doesn&rsquo;t go down in <i>our</i>
college. We have student government, and I happen
to be chairman of the student exec. just now. You
better change your tactics if you expect to remain here.
Excuse me, I see a friend up at the front of the car!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With which remarks Howard Letchworth strode
across the sprawling legs of his fellow-traveller and
departed up the aisle, leaving the elegant stranger to
enjoy the whole seat and his own company.</p>
<p>Thus did Clive Terrence introduce himself to
Howard Letchworth and bring dismay into the little
clique of four young people who had been enjoying
a most unusually perfect friendship. Howard
Letchworth, as he stood the rest of the ride on the
front platform of the car conversing with apparent interest
with a fraternity brother, was nevertheless filled
with a growing dismay. Now and then he glanced
back and glared down the aisle at the elegant sprawling
youth and wondered how it was that a being as insignificant
as that could so upset his equilibrium. But the
assured drawl of the stranger as he spoke of Leslie and
called her a &ldquo;speedy kid&rdquo; had made him boil with
rage. He carried the mood back to college with him,
and sat gloomily at the table thinking the whole incident
over, while the banter and chaffing went on about
him unnoticed. Underneath it all there was a deep
uneasiness that would not be set aside. The young
man had said that the Clouds were very wealthy. That
Leslie was especially so. That when she was of age
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
she would have a vast inheritance. There had been
no sign of great wealth or ostentation in their living
but if that were so then there was an insuperable wall
between him and her.</p>
<p>It was strange that the question of wealth had never
come up between them. Howard had known that they
were comfortably off, of course. They had a beautiful
car and wore good clothes, and were always free with
their entertaining, but they lived in a modest
house, and never made any pretences. It had
not occurred to him that they were any better off
than he might be some day if he worked hard. They
never talked about their circumstances. Of course, now
he came to think about it, there were fine mahogany
pieces of furniture in the little house and wonderful
rugs and things, but they all fitted in so harmoniously
with their surroundings that it never occurred to him
that they might have cost a mint of money. They
never cried out their price to those who saw them,
they were simply the fitting thing in the fitting place,
doing their service as all right-minded things both
animate and inanimate in this world should do. It was
the first serpent in the Eden of this wonderful friendship
at Cloudy Villa and it stung the proud-spirited
young man to the soul.</p>
<p>Alone in his room that night he finally gave up all
pretence at study and faced the truth. He had been
drifting in a delightful dream during the last two
years, with only a vague and alluring idea of the future
before him, a future in which there was no question
but that Allison Cloud AND his sister Leslie should
figure intimately. Now he was suddenly and roughly
awakened to ask himself whether he had any right to
count on all this. If these young people belonged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
to the favored few of the world who were rolling in
wealth, wasn&rsquo;t it altogether likely that when they finished
college they would pass out of this comradely
atmosphere into a world of their own, with a new set
of laws whereby to judge and choose their friends
and life companions? He could not quite imagine
Allison and Leslie as anything but the frank, friendly,
enthusiastic comrades they had been since he had known
them&ndash;&ndash;and yet&ndash;&ndash;he knew the world, knew what the
love of money could do to a human soul, for he had
seen it many times before in people he had come to
love and trust who had grown selfish and forgetful as
soon as money and power were put into their hands.
He had to confess that it was possible. Also, his own
pride forbade him to wish to force himself into a crowd
where he could not hold his own and pay his part.
They would simply not be in his class, at least not
for many years to come, and his heart sank with desolation.
It was then, and not till then, that the heart
of the trouble came out and looked him in the face.
It was not that he could not be in their class, that he
could not keep pace with Allison Cloud and come and
go in his company as freely as he had done; it was
that he loved the bright-haired Leslie, the sweet-faced,
eager, earnest, wonderful girl. She held his future happiness
in her little rosy hand, and if she really were a rich
girl he couldn&rsquo;t of course tell her now that he loved her,
because he was a poor man. He didn&rsquo;t expect to stay
poor always, of course, but it would be a great many
years before he could ever hope to compete with anything
like wealth, and during those years who might
not take her from him? Was it conceivable that such
a cad as that youth who had boasted himself a playmate
of her childhood could possibly win her?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></div>
<p>Howard went out and sat on the campus under a
great shadowing tree. He watched a silver thread of
a moon slip down between the branches and dip behind
the hill, and while he sat there he went through all the
desolation of a lonely life; the bitterness of having
Leslie taken from him by one who was unworthy!&ndash;&ndash;He
persuaded himself that he loved her enough to be
willing to step aside and give her up to a man who
was better than himself&ndash;&ndash;but this little whiffet&ndash;&ndash;ugh!</p>
<p>The chimes on the library pealed out nine o&rsquo;clock,
reminding him of his work half done, yet the shadow
of engulfing sorrow and loss hung over him. With a
jerk he drew himself up and tried to grasp at common
sense. How ridiculous of him to get up all this nightmare
out of a few minutes&rsquo; talk with a fellow who used
to be the Clouds&rsquo; old neighbor. He might not have
been telling the truth. And anyhow it was a libel on
friendship to distrust them all this way, as though
riches were some kind of a disease like leprosy that set
people apart. It wasn&rsquo;t his night to go down to the
village, but just to dispel this nonsense and bring back
his normal state of mind he would go and drop in on the
Clouds for a few minutes. A sight of them all would
reassure him and clear his brain for the work he must
do before midnight. Leslie Cloud was very young yet,
and much can happen in a year or two. He might
even be in a fair way to make a fortune himself somewhere,
who knew? And as for that little cad, it was
nonsense to suppose he was anything to fear. Besides,
it wasn&rsquo;t time yet to think about being married
when he wasn&rsquo;t even out of college. He would forget
it and work the harder. Of course he could never
quite go back and forget that he had admitted to himself
that he was in love with Leslie, but he would keep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
it like a precious jewel hid far in his heart, so carefully
locked that not even for his own delight would he
take it out to look at now at this time.</p>
<p>Having thus resolved, a weight seemed to have
rolled from his shoulders and he sprang up and walked
with a quick tread down to the village. There was
a cheerful clang of victrolas, player-pianos and twanging
guitars as he passed the fraternity rooms, and he
went whistling on his way toward Cloudy Villa.</p>
<p>But as he neared the tall arched hedge, and looked
eagerly for the welcome light, he saw that the big
living-room windows were only lit by a soft play of
firelight. Did that mean they were all sitting in the
firelight around the hearth? A fearful thought of the
stranger intruded just here upon his fine resolves,
and to dispel it he knocked noisily on the little
brass knocker.</p>
<p>It was very still inside, but a quick electric light
responded to his knock and in a moment he could
hear someone coming down-stairs to the door. His
heart leaped. Could it be Leslie? Ah! He must not&ndash;&ndash;yet
how wonderful it was going to be to look at her
this first time after really knowing his own heart in
plain language. Could he keep the joy of her out of
his eyes, and the wonder of her from his voice? Then
the door opened and there stood Cherry in neglig&eacute;e of
flaring rosy cotton cr&ecirc;pe embroidered with gorgeous
peacocks, and her pigtails in eclipse behind an arrangement
of cheap lace and pink ribbons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, Mister Howard, dey ain&rsquo;t none ob &rsquo;em
heah! Dey got cumpney&ndash;&ndash;some young fellah fum
back to Californy way. Dey done tuk him out to see
de town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Howard&rsquo;s heart sank and he turned his heavy footsteps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
back to college. The worst fear had come to pass.
Of course reason asserted itself, and he told himself
that he was a fool, a perfect fool. Of course they
had to be polite to an old neighbor whether they liked
him or not. And what was he to presume to judge a
stranger from a five-minute conversation, and turn
him down so completely that he wasn&rsquo;t willing to have
his old friends even like him? Well, he was worse
than he had thought himself and something would have
to be done about it.</p>
<p>What he did about it was to stay away from Cloudy
Villa for almost a week, and when Leslie at last, after
repeated efforts to get hold of him by telephone, called
him up to say there was an important committee meeting
at the church which he ought to attend, he excused
his long absence by telling how busy he had been.
Of course he had been busy, but Leslie knew that he
had always been busy, and yet had found time to come
in often. She was inclined to be hurt and just the
least bit stand-offish. Of course if he didn&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to
come he needn&rsquo;t! And she took Clive Terrence driving
in the car and showed him all the wonders of the surrounding
neighborhood with much more cordiality than
she really felt. It was her way of bearing her hurt.
At last she got Allison by himself and asked him quite
casually why Howard hadn&rsquo;t been down. But Allison,
in haste to keep an appointment with Jane, and knowing
that Howard enjoyed being down as much as they
wanted him, hadn&rsquo;t even noticed the absence yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s up to his eyes in work,&rdquo; responded
Allison. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s likely busy as a one-armed paper-hanger
with fleas! He&rsquo;s a senior, you know. Wait
till next year and you&rsquo;ll see me in the same boat!&rdquo; and
he hurried away whistling.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
</div>
<p>Clive Terrence hung around. He calmly
took it for granted that the Clouds wanted
him as long as he condescended to stay. In
fact, it wouldn&rsquo;t have troubled him whether they
wanted him or not if he wanted to stay. He
had discovered that Leslie was the very same kind of
a &ldquo;peach&rdquo; which her younger days had promised her
to be, and there was plenty of good fun, so he stayed.
He said he wanted to see what the college was like
before he made his decision, and day after day went
by with apparently no plans whatever for leaving in
the near future.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud didn&rsquo;t like him. She admitted that
much to herself the very first evening, and for that
reason she was twice as cordial to him as she might
have been if she had liked him better. She reasoned
that it was unfair to take a sudden dislike that way,
and perhaps it was only a sign he needed a bit of their
home all the more. So she made him welcome and
treated him as she did any other boys who came. But
more and more as the days slipped by she did not like
him. At first she was a bit worried about his influence
on Allison, till she saw that he merely annoyed Allison.
Then she began to be annoyed by his constant attendance
on Leslie. And finally she grew exceedingly restless
and anxious as day succeeded day and Howard
came no more. Finally, one evening just before dinner,
she went to the &rsquo;phone and called up the college.
It happened that she caught Howard just as he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
going down to dinner. She told him they were homesick
for him and there was roast lamb and green peas
and strawberry shortcake for dinner, wouldn&rsquo;t he
come? He came. Who could refuse Julia Cloud?</p>
<p>But the face of Clive Terrence was a study when,
unannounced, Howard entered the living-room. Julia
Cloud had seen him coming and quietly opened the
door. Such a storm of delighted welcome as met him
warmed his heart and dispelled the evil spirits that had
haunted him during the week.</p>
<p>In the chatter of talk while they were being seated
at the dinner table the visitor was almost forgotten,
and he sat watching them glumly while Allison and
Leslie eagerly discussed plans for some society in which
they seemed to be interested. At last he grew weary
of being ignored and in the first pause he languidly
drawled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leslie, I think you and I&rsquo;ll take the cah and go in
town to a show this evening. I&rsquo;m bored to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie looked at him with flashing eyes and then
extinguished him with her cool tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you? Well, think again! I&rsquo;m having a lovely
time&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and went on talking to Howard about the
senior play that was to come off the next week. It did
not suit Clive in the least to be ignored, so he started
in to tell about other senior plays in other colleges
where he had been and quite made himself the centre
of the stage, laughing at his own jokes and addressing
all his remarks to Leslie until her cheeks grew hot with
annoyance. She wanted so to hear what Howard and
Allison were talking about in low, grave tones. She
watched the strong, fine face of Howard Letchworth,
and it suddenly came over her that he seemed very far
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
away from her, like a friend who used to be, but had
moved away. Something in her throat hurt, and a
sinking feeling came in her heart. Like a flash it came
to her that Howard Letchworth would be graduated in
three more weeks, and perhaps would go away then
and they would see him no more. She caught a word
or two now and then as he talked to Allison that indicated
that he was seriously contemplating such a possibility.
Yet he had not said a word to her about it!
And they had been such good friends! A grieved look
began to grow around her expressive little cupid&rsquo;s bow
of a mouth, and her big eyes grew sorrowful as she
watched the two. She was not listening to Clive, who
drawled on unaware of her inattention.</p>
<p>Suddenly Leslie became aware that Clive had risen
and was standing over her with something in his hand
which he had taken from his vest, something small and
shining, and he was saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to wear it, Les? Here, I&rsquo;ll put it on you,
then everybody will think we are engaged&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was his fraternity pin he was holding out with
smiling assurance and the significance of his words
came over her as a sentence read without comprehension
will suddenly recall itself and pierce into the realization.
With a stifled cry she sprang away from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy, no, Clive! I didn&rsquo;t know you were so
silly. I never wear boys&rsquo; fraternity pins. I think
such things are too sacred to be trifled with!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was what she said, but she was miserably
aware that Howard had turned away and picked up his
hat just as Clive had leaned over her with the pin,
and almost immediately he left. He had been so
engrossed with his talk with Allison that he had not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
seemed to see her repulsion of Clive, and his manner
toward her as he bade her good-night was cool and
distant. All the pleasant intimacy of all the months
together seemed suddenly wiped out, and Howard a
grown-up stranger. She felt herself a miserably unhappy
little girl.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud, from the advantage of the dining-room
where she was doing little things, for the next
day, watched the drama with a heavy heart. What
had come between her children, and what could she
do about it? The only comforting thing about it
seemed to be that each was as unhappy as the other.
Could it be that Howard Letchworth was jealous of
this small-souled, spoiled son of fortune who was visiting
them? Surely not. Yet what made him act in
this ridiculous fashion? She felt like shaking him
even while she pitied him. She half-meditated calling
him back and trying to find out what was the matter, but
gave it up. After all, what could she do?</p>
<p>Leslie, as the door closed behind Howard, turned
with one dagger look at Clive, and dashed up-stairs to
her room, where she locked herself in and cried till her
eyes were too swollen for study; but she only told
Julia Cloud, when she came up gently to inquire, that
she had a bad headache and wanted to go to bed.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud, kneeling beside her gray couch a little
later, laying all her troubles on the One who was her
strength, found it hard not to emphasize her dislike
even in prayer toward the useless little excuse for a
young man who was lolling down-stairs reading a
novel and smoking innumerable cigarettes in spite of
her expressed wish to the contrary.</p>
<p>The first Sunday after young Terrence&rsquo;s arrival it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
rained and was very dismal and cold for spring.
Howard had been asked to go to a nearby Reform
School for the afternoon and speak to the boys, and
Jane was caring for a little child whose mother was
ill in the hospital. Leslie was unhappy and restless,
wandering from window to window looking out. Their
guest had chosen to remain in bed that morning, so
relieving them from the necessity of trying to get him
to go to church, but he was on hand for lunch in
immaculate attire, apparently ready for a holiday.
There was a cozy fire on the hearth, and he lolled
luxuriously in an arm-chair seemingly well pleased
with himself and all the world. Julia Cloud wondered
just what she would better do about the afternoon
hour with this uncongenial guest on hand, but Leslie
and Allison, after a hasty whispered consultation in
the dining-room with numerous dubious glances toward
the guest, ending in wry faces, came and settled down
with their Bibles as usual. There was a loyalty in the
quiet act that almost brought the tears to Julia Cloud&rsquo;s
eyes, and she rewarded them with a loving, understanding
smile.</p>
<p>But when the guest was asked to join the little
circle he only stared in amazement. He had no idea
of trying to conform to their habits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks! No! I hate reading aloud. Books
always bore me anyway. The <i>Bible</i>! Oh <i>Heck</i>! NO!
Count me out!&rdquo; And he swung one leg over the arm
of his chair, and picked up the Sunday illustrated supplement
which he had gone out and purchased, and
which was now strewn all about the floor. He continued
for sometime to rattle the paper and whistle in
a low tone rudely while the reading went on, then he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
threw down his paper and lighted a cigarette. But
that did not seem to soothe his nerves sufficiently, so
he strolled over to the piano and began to drum bits of
popular airs and sing in a high nasal tone that he was
pleased to call &ldquo;whiskey tenor.&rdquo; Julia Cloud, with a
despairing glance at him, finally closed her book and
suggested that they had read enough for that day, and
the little audience drifted away unhappily to their
rooms. Leslie did not come down again all the afternoon
until just time for Christian Endeavor. Young
Terrence by this time was reduced to almost affability,
and looked up hopefully. He was about to propose a
game of cards, but when he saw Leslie attired in raincoat
and hat he stared:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott! You don&rsquo;t have to go up to college
to-night, do you? It&rsquo;s raining cats and dogs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allison and I are going to Christian Endeavor,&rdquo;
answered Leslie quietly. &ldquo;Would you like to go?&rdquo;
She had been trying to school herself to give this invitation
because she thought she ought to, but she hoped
sincerely it would not be accepted. It seemed as if
she could not bear to have the whole day spoiled.</p>
<p>For answer young Terrence laughed extravagantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christian Endeavor! What&rsquo;s the little old idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better come and find out,&rdquo; said Allison, coming
down-stairs just then. &ldquo;Ready, Leslie? We&rsquo;ll have
to hustle. It&rsquo;s getting late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In alarm at the idea of spending any more time
alone the young man arose most unexpectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure! I&rsquo;ll go! Anything for a little fun!&rdquo;
and he joined them in a moment more, clad in rubber
coat and storm hat.</p>
<p>Leslie could scarcely keep back the tears as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
walked beside him through the dark street, not listening
to his boasting about riding the waves in Hawaii.
Suppose Howard was at meeting! He would think&ndash;&ndash;what
would he think?</p>
<p>And of course Howard was at the meeting that
night, for he happened to be the leader. Leslie&rsquo;s cheeks
burned as she sat down and saw that Clive had
man&oelig;uvred to sit beside her. She tried to catch
Howard&rsquo;s eyes and fling a greeting to him, but he
seemed not to see his old friends and to be utterly
absorbed in hunting up hymns.</p>
<p>The first song had scarcely died away before Clive
began a conversation with a low growl, making remarks
of what he apparently considered a comic nature
about everything and everybody in the room, with a
distinctness that made them entirely audible to those
seated around them. Leslie&rsquo;s cheeks flamed and her
eyes flashed angrily, but he only seemed to enjoy it the
more, and kept on with his running commentary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake, Clive, keep still, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
whispered Leslie anxiously. &ldquo;They will think you
never had any bringing up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should worry!&rdquo; shrugged the amiable Clive
comically with a motion of his handsome shoulders
that sent two susceptible young things near him into
a series of poorly suppressed giggles. Clive looked up
and gravely winked at them, and the two bent down
their heads in sudden hopeless mirth. Clive was delighted.
He was having a grand time. He could see
that the leader was annoyed and disgusted. This was
balm to his bored soul. He made more remarks under
cover of a bowed head during the prayer, and stole
glances at the two giggling neighbors. Then he nudged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
Leslie and endeavored to get her to join in the mirth.
Poor Leslie with her burning cheeks, her brimming
eyes, and her angry heart! Her last vision of the
leader as she bowed her head had been a haughty,
annoyed glance in their direction as he said: &ldquo;Let us
pray.&rdquo; She felt that she could not stand another minute
of this torture. Almost she felt she must get up
and go out, and she made a hasty little movement
to carry out the impulse, and then suddenly it came
to her that if she went Clive would follow her, and it
would look to Howard as if she had created the disturbance
and they had gone off together to have a
good time. So she settled down to endure the rest of
the meeting, lifting miserable eyes of appeal to Allison
as soon as the prayer was ended. If only there had
been a seat vacant up front somewhere, a single seat
with no other near it, where her tormentor could not
follow, she would have gone to it swiftly, but the seats
were all filled and there was nothing to do but sit still
and frown her disapproval. Perhaps Allison might
have done something to quiet the guest if he had
noticed, but Allison was, at the moment of Leslie&rsquo;s
appeal, deeply wrapped in setting down a few items
which must be announced, and he almost immediately
arose and went forward with his slip of paper and
held a whispered converse with Howard Letchworth
during the hymn that followed, afterwards taking a
chair down from the platform and placing it beside
the chairman of an important committee that he might
consult with him about something. During this sudden
move on the part of Allison, Clive Terrence did have
his attention turned aside somewhat from his mischief-making,
for he was watching Allison with an amazed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
expression. Not anything that he had seen since coming
to the town had so astonished him as to see this
young man of wealth and position and undoubted
strength of will and purpose, get up in a church and
go forward as if he had some business in the affair.
He sat up, with his loose, handsome under lip half-dropped
in surprise, and watched Allison, with a curious
startled expression, and when a moment later the
leader said quietly: &ldquo;Our president has a message for
us&rdquo; and Allison arose and faced the crowded room
with an eager, spirited, interested look on his face,
and began to talk earnestly, outlining a plan for a
deeper spiritual life among the members, his expression
was one of utter bewilderment, as if he suddenly saw
trees walking about the streets or inanimate objects
beginning to show signs of intellect. He was thinking
that Allison Cloud certainly had changed, and was
wondering what on earth had brought it about. It
couldn&rsquo;t be any line that his guardian had on him, for he
was a thousand miles away. Was it that little, quiet,
insipid mouse of an aunt that had done it? She must
be rich or something, the way the brother and sister
seemed to be tied to her apron-string. Where did Al
Cloud get that line of talk he was handing out, anyway?
Why, he talked about God as if He were an intimate
friend of his, and spoke of prayer and Bible reading
in the way common, ordinary people talked of going to
breakfast or eating candy, as if they were necessary
and pleasurable acts. Why, it was inconceivable!
What was he doing it for? There must be a reason.</p>
<p>For fully five minutes he sat quiet in puzzled
thought, watching this strange gathering, gradually
taking it in that they were all taking part in the proceedings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
and that they seemed interested and eager.
Why, even those two giggling girls who had &ldquo;fallen&rdquo;
so readily for his nonsense had sobered down and one
read a verse from the Bible while the other repeated a
verse of poetry! He turned and blinked at them in
wonder. What had so influenced them that they all fell
in line and performed their part as if it were being
rehearsed for his benefit? What was the motive power?
The query interested him to the point of good behavior
all through the remainder of the meeting, and
while he was standing waiting for Allison and Leslie at
the close. It seemed that somehow there was a real
interest, for they lingered as if there were vital matters
to discuss, and Leslie was the centre of a group of
quite common-looking girls. It must be some sort
of social settlement work or other connected with the
church and someone had induced these two who were
to his thinking of a higher order of being by right
of wealth and social position, to take an interest and
&ldquo;run&rdquo; this society or whatever it was. He could not
make it out at all. He was much disgusted that the
young people insisted on staying to church and had a
bad hour living through it, although he was surprised to
find it as interesting as it was. The minister seemed
quite human and they had a great deal of singing. Still
it was all a bore, of course. He found a great many
things in life to bore him.</p>
<p>As soon as he and Allison were out on the street
he broached the subject:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the little old idea, old man? Are you
a sort of grand mogul or high priest or something
to this mob? And what do you get out of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison turned and looked solemnly at him through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
the dark, and answered with a kind of glow in his
voice that seemed to lighten his face and puzzled the
questioner more than all that had gone before:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just one of them, son, and it happens to be
my turn just now to be presiding officer; but I get out
of it more than I ever got out of anything in life before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Clive inanely, quite at a loss to know
what he meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew before that people could know God
personally, be His pal sort of, you know, and work
with Him, and it&rsquo;s been GREAT!&rdquo; added Allison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Clive once more, quite weakly, not
knowing what else to say, and they walked on for almost
a block without speaking another word. Clive was
thinking that certainly Allison had changed, as that
unmannerly chump on the train had said. Changed
most perplexingly and peculiarly. But Allison had forgotten
almost that Clive was there. He was thinking
over some good news he had to tell Jane about a
prot&eacute;g&eacute; of hers who had taken a shy part in the
meeting, and wondering if he could get away for a few
minutes to run up and tell her or if it would be better
to call her up on the &rsquo;phone.</p>
<p>Howard Letchworth had not come home with them.
He had whispered a hurried excuse to Allison about
someone he had to see up at college before they left
for the city, and hurried away at the close of the meeting,
and Leslie with a choking feeling in her throat
and burning tears held back from her eyes by mighty
effort, announced to Allison that she wasn&rsquo;t coming
home just now, she was going to stay for a little after
prayer meeting the Lookout Committee were having.
She would walk home with the Martins, who went right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
by their door. For Leslie was done with Clive Terrence
and she wanted him to understand it. So Clive was
landed at home with Julia Cloud for companion, who
had not gone to church on account of staying to nurse
Cherry, who had taken a bad cold and needed medicine.
Allison hurried away to give Jane her message, and
there was nothing for Clive to do but to go to bed and
resolve never to spend another Sunday in such boredom.
For he &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t see&rdquo; hobnobbing with an
&ldquo;old woman,&rdquo; as he called Julia Cloud, the way the
others seemed entirely willing to do. What was she
anyway but some poor relation likely who was acting
as housekeeper? But at least for once in his life Clive
Terrence realized that there was such a thing in the
world as a live religion and a few people who held to it
and loved it and <i>enjoyed</i> it. He couldn&rsquo;t understand
it, but he had to admit it, although he was convinced
that behind it all there must be some ulterior motive or
those people would never bother themselves to
that extent.</p>
<p>But Leslie came home from the church with a
heavy heart and crept up to her room with bravely
cheerful smiles to deceive Julia Cloud; and then cried
herself to sleep; while Julia Cloud, wise-eyed, kept her
own counsel and carried her perplexities to the throne
of God.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
</div>
<p>During the next three days there were stirring
times, and Leslie, even with a heavy heart,
was kept busy. Clive Terrence was ignored
as utterly as if he had been a fly on the ceiling, and
Leslie managed to keep every minute full. Moreover,
her mind was so much occupied with other things that
she had not time to realize how fully she was cutting
their guest out of sight of her, nor how utterly amazed
it made him. He was not accustomed to being ignored
by young ladies, even though they were both beautiful
and rich. He felt that he was quite ornamental himself,
and had plenty of money, too, and he could not
brook any such treatment. So he set himself to procure
revenge by going hot-foot after the Freshman
&ldquo;vamp&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;who, to tell the truth, was much more in his
style than Leslie and quite, <i>quite</i> willing&ndash;&ndash;though
Leslie, dear child, was too absorbed to know it.</p>
<p>She came home at lunchtime a bit late and called
Allison from the table to give him an excited account
in a low tone of something that had happened that
morning. Julia Cloud, from her vantage point at the
head of the table, could see the flash in her eye and the
brilliant flush of the soft cheeks as she talked and
wondered what new trouble had come to the dear child.
Then she noted the sudden stern set of Allison&rsquo;s jaw
and the squaring of shoulder as he listened and questioned.
Meanwhile she passed Clive Terrence the muffins
and jam, and urged more iced-tea and a hot, stuffed
potato, and kept up a pleasant hum of talk so that the
excited words should not be heard in the dining-room.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Jane&rsquo;s had a perfectly terrible time!&rdquo; had been
Leslie&rsquo;s opening sentence, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ve got to do something
about it! Those little <i>cats</i> in the AOU have
done the meanest thing you can think of. Jane looked
just <i>crushed</i>! They&rsquo;ve hauled up that old stuff about
her father being a forger and urged it as a reason that
she shouldn&rsquo;t be made treasurer in place of Anne Dallas&ndash;&ndash;who
is leaving on account of the death of her father
and she has to go home and take care of her little sisters&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='smcap'>Jane heard them</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low growl of indignation reached Julia Cloud&rsquo;s
ears from Allison, who squared his shoulders into position
for immediate action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They said&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; went on Leslie in excited whisper.
&ldquo;They said that since we had such a large sum to look
out for now that the subscriptions for the sorority
house were coming in, we should put in a treasurer
of tried and true integrity. Yes, they used just those
words, <i>tried and true integrity</i>! Think of it! And
<span class='smcap'>our Jane</span>! The idea! The catty little snobs! The
jealous little&ndash;&ndash;<i>cats</i>! No, it wasn&rsquo;t Eugenia Frazer who
<i>said</i> it, it was Eunice Brice&ndash;&ndash;but I&rsquo;m certain she was
at the bottom of it, for she sat with her nice smug
little painted face as sweet and complacent as an angel,
all the time it was going on, and she <i>seconded the
motion</i>! Just like that! With a <span class='smcap'>smile</span>, too! She
said she fully agreed with what Miss Brice had said.
<i>Agreed!</i> H&rsquo;m! As if every one didn&rsquo;t know she had
started it, and got it all fixed up with enough girls to
carry the motion before the rest of us got down from
an exam. Yes, they had it thought out as carefully as
that! They knew all the sophomore girls would be
up in that exam. till almost twelve o&rsquo;clock, for it&rsquo;s
always as long as the moral law, anything with Professor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
Crabbs&ndash;&ndash;and they counted up and had just
enough to a name to carry their motion. They even
got Marian Hobbs to cut a class to get there. They
hadn&rsquo;t counted on my getting in in time to hear, I
guess, or else they didn&rsquo;t care. Perhaps they wanted
me to hear it all; I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. I suppose
that must have been it. They thought perhaps I&rsquo;d tell
<i>you</i> and that would stop you from going with Jane.
You know Eugenia and Eunice are both crazy about
you, especially Eugenia&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An impatient exclamation from Allison reached
the dining-room thunderously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was Jane?&rdquo; Julia Cloud caught that
anxious question, and then Clive, who had evidently
heard also, roused himself to ask a question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this <i>Jane</i> person they talk so much about?
I don&rsquo;t seem to have seen her! Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is Miss Bristol,&rdquo; said Julia Cloud, stiffening
just a little at the young fellow&rsquo;s tone of insolence.
&ldquo;She is in college and very busy, but has been unusually
busy since you have been here because she is
caring for a little child whose mother has been
very ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&ndash;&ndash;You mean she&rsquo;s a sort of sehvant?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;He
drawled the question most offensively, and Julia Cloud
had a sudden ridiculous impulse to seize his sleek shoulder
and shake him. Instead she only smiled and
quoted a Bible verse: &ldquo;I have seen servants upon
horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clive eyed her with a puzzled expression:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t getcha!&rdquo; he answered finally, but Julia
Cloud made no further comment than to pass him a
second cup of coffee. She could hear the soft excited
whispers still going on in the living-room and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
longed to fly in there and leave this ill-bred guest to
his own devices, for she knew something must have
happened to trouble her children, and that if this intruder
were not present she would be at once taken into
their confidence. Still she had to sit and smile and
keep him from hearing them.</p>
<p>Leslie was talking more softly now, with cautious
looks toward the dining-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane had finished her exam. and hurried down
because she thought there would be a lot of business
and she wanted Emily Reeder to be put in treasurer
and was trying to work it, and hadn&rsquo;t an idea Alice and
I were working it to put <i>her</i> in. We didn&rsquo;t think she
would get there and meant to have it all finished before
she came, but someone turned around and gave a queer
little cough just as Eunice finished her nasty speech,
and we all turned quickly and there in the open door
stood Jane, as white as a sheet, with her great, big
blue eyes looking black as coals and such suffering I
never saw in a human face&ndash;&ndash;and she just stood and
looked at them all, a hurt, loving, searching look, as
if she was reading their souls, and no one spoke nor
moved, only Eunice, who got very red, and Eugenia,
who straightened up and got haughty and hateful,
looking as if she was glad Jane heard it all. She had a
kind of glitter in her eyes, like triumph&ndash;&ndash;and it was
very still for a whole minute, and then Jane put out her
hands in a little, quick, pleading motion and turned
away quickly and was gone&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you do?&rdquo; Allison&rsquo;s tone had hope,
threat, condemnation and praise all held in abeyance
on her answer.</p>
<p>Leslie drew herself up eagerly, her eyes shining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;? Oh&ndash;&ndash;I wanted to run after her and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
comfort her, but I had something else to do. I jumped
up and offered my resignation to the AOU, and said I
wished to withdraw my subscription to the Sorority
House, that I couldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with a
bunch of girls that would stand for a thing as contemptible
and mean as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; said Allison with a proud look at
his sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Phoebe Kemp jumped up and withdrew hers
until they all apologized to Jane, and then Alice Lowe
said she&rsquo;d have to withdraw hers, too&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s given the
highest amount subscribed, you know; she has slews
of money all in her own right, because she&rsquo;s of age,
you know&ndash;&ndash;and then the girls began to get scared and
Elsie Dare got right up and said she thought there
had been some kind of a mistake&ndash;&ndash;a blunder&ndash;&ndash;they
mustn&rsquo;t get excited&ndash;&ndash;they must begin all over, and
somebody must go after Jane and bring her back and
explain&ndash;&ndash;as if there was any way to explain a bold,
bare insult like that!&ndash;&ndash;and they sent a committee after
her. They wanted me to go, but I declined to go in
their name. I said I had handed in my resignation
and I wasn&rsquo;t one of them any more, and they might
send somebody who would better represent them, and
they said they hadn&rsquo;t accepted my resignation and a lot
of stuff, but they sent off a committee to find Jane,
and they tried to think up something quickly to say
to her, and they got Eunice Brice to crying and made
Eugenia real mad so the powder came off her nose
from rubbing it so much, and I came away. I&rsquo;ve been
hunting for Jane for half an hour, but I can&rsquo;t find
her in any of the places she always is, and I thought
I better come and tell you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;ll find her&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Allison made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
one step to the hat-rack and took his hat, then raising
his voice: &ldquo;Cloudy, I&rsquo;ve been called away on business
suddenly. Don&rsquo;t bother keeping anything for me, I&rsquo;ve
had all I want&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; and he was gone.</p>
<p>Julia Cloud gave a glance at Allison&rsquo;s plate and saw
that he had scarcely touched his lunch, and she sighed
as she heard Leslie run quickly up the stairs and shut
the door of her own room. Was Leslie going to spend
the afternoon in weeping?</p>
<p>But Leslie was down again in a moment and standing
in the doorway, her curls tumbled, her eyes bright
and anxious, an indignant little set of lips and chin
giving her a worried expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jewel, dear, I&rsquo;ve got to go; there&rsquo;s something important
on&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll tell you about it all when I get back.
No, please, I couldn&rsquo;t eat now. You get Cherry to save
me some strawberry shortcake.&rdquo; And she was off
like a breeze and out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Leslie, I&rsquo;ll go up with you,&rdquo; called
Clive with his mouth full of shortcake and cream, but
Leslie was already whirling down the street like the
wind. Allison had taken the car, so there was nothing
left for Clive to do but finish his shortcake and think
up some form of amusement with the Freshman vamp
for the afternoon.</p>
<p>Allison, meantime, had made a straight dash for
the college and sent a message up to Jane that he must
see her at once on very important business. After what
seemed to him an endless wait, word came down that
Jane was not in her room and her roommate knew nothing
of her whereabouts. Allison made a wild dive for
his car and drove to every one of the places where Jane
sometimes went to help out with the children when
their mothers were particularly busy, but no Jane
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
materialized. He drove madly back to the college, forgetting
his usual cool philosophy of life and fancying
all sorts of terrible things that might have happened
to Jane. He swept past Eugenia Frazer without even
seeing her and brought up in front of the office once
more, intending to send up and see if Jane had yet
returned, but on the steps stood Leslie waiting for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone to the woods up above the old quarry!&rdquo;
she said anxiously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just found out. Benny,
the kitchen boy, told me. He says he saw her go out
between Chemistry Hall and the Boys&rsquo; Gym. about an
hour ago. She must have gone right after she left
the meeting. Nobody seems to have seen her since.
Nobody but Benny knows anything about her going to
the woods and I gave him some money and told him
not to say anything about it if anyone asked. I was
just going to hunt her&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, kid! You take the car and follow
up the road. I&rsquo;ll go through the woods and look
for her&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo; said Allison, springing out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be careful, won&rsquo;t you? You know that
quarry is terribly deep&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>know</i>!&rdquo; said Allison, his tone showing his own
anxiety. &ldquo;And Jane hasn&rsquo;t scrambled around here
as much as we have; she hasn&rsquo;t had the time. And
there is so much undergrowth close up to the edge,
one could come on it unaware&ndash;&ndash;especially if one was
excited, and not paying attention&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;! I better beat
it! Jump in and drive me around college and I&rsquo;ll get
off at the gym.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie sprang in and Allison stood on the running-board.
His sister cast a wistful glance at him as she
started the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allison&ndash;&ndash;I think maybe you needn&rsquo;t worry&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
she said softly. &ldquo;You know Jane is&ndash;&ndash;<span class='smcap'>real</span>! She
isn&rsquo;t weak like some people. She won&rsquo;t go all to pieces
like&ndash;&ndash;well, like I would. God means something to
her, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; said Allison gravely, gently. &ldquo;Thank
you, kid! Well. I get off here. Meet me at the top
of the second hill in half an hour, and hang around
there for a bit. I may whistle, see? So long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dashed off between the buildings and disappeared
between the trees in the edge of the woods.
Leslie whirled off down the drive to the street. As
she passed the big stone gateway, ivy garlanded and
sweet with climbing roses, three seniors turned into
the drive, and the foremost of the three was Howard
Letchworth. Her heart leaped up with joy that here
was someone who would understand and sympathize,
and she put her foot to the brake to slow down with a
light of welcome in her eyes, but before she could stop
he had lifted his hat and passed on with the others as if
he were just anyone. Of course he had not seen her
intention, did not realize that she wanted to speak with
him, yet it hurt her. A week or two before she would
have called after him, or even backed the car to catch
him, but now something froze within her and with her
heart beating wildly, and tears scorching her eyes,
she put on speed and whirled away up the hill. It
seemed to her that all her lovely world was breaking
into pieces under her feet. If it had not been that
she was worried about Jane, she would have been
tempted to abandon everything and rush off in some
wild way by herself, anywhere to be alone and face
the ache in her heart. It was such a torrent of deep-mingled
feelings, hurt pride and anger, humiliation, and
pain&ndash;&ndash;all these words rushed through her mind, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
there was something else besides, something that ought
to have been beautiful and wonderful, and was only
shame and pain, and she had not yet come to the point
where she was willing to call that something by name.
She knew that soon she must face the truth and have it
out with herself, and so her cheeks flamed and paled,
and the tears scorched and hurt in her eyes and throat,
and she tried to put it all away and think about Jane,
poor hurt Jane. Jane gone into the woods to have it
but with herself. But Jane was strong and Jane trusted
in God. Her God was strong, too! Jane would come
through only the sweeter. But what would become of
her&ndash;&ndash;little, fiery, tempestuous Leslie, who always did
the wrong thing first and was sorry afterwards, and
who forgot God when she needed Him most? These
thoughts flitted like visions through her brain while
she put on all speed and tore away up the hill at a
much faster rate than she had any business to do. But
the road was clear ahead of her and there was some
relief in flying along through space this way. It
seemed to clear the mists from her brain, and cool
down her throbbing pulses. Yet just when she would
think she had control of her thoughts, that stern, distant
expression on Howard&rsquo;s face would come between
her and the afternoon brightness, and back
would roll the trouble with renewed vigor. What a
world this was anyway and why did people have to
live? Just trouble, trouble, trouble, everywhere! And
who would have thought there would come trouble between
her and Howard, such good friends as they
had been now almost two years&ndash;&ndash;two wonderful years!
And again her weary brain would beat over the question,
what had been the matter? What made Howard
act that way? Surely nothing she could have done.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
</div>
<p>Meantime Allison was dashing over fallen
trees, climbing rocks, and pushing his way
between tangled vines and close-grown laurel,
up and up through the college woods, and across country
in the direction of the quarry, a still, wonderful
place like a cathedral, with a deep, dark pool at the
bottom of the massive stone walls. There were over-arching
pines, hemlocks, and oaks for vaulted roof
with the fresco of sky and flying cloud between. It
was a wonderful place. Once when they had climbed
there together and stood for a long time in silence
watching the shadows on the deep pool below, looking
up to the arching green, and listening to the praisings
of a song sparrow up above in some hidden choir, Jane
had said that this was a place to come and worship&ndash;&ndash;or
to come when one was in trouble! A place where
one might meet God! He had looked down at her
sweet face upturned searching for the little thrilling
singer, and had thought how sweet and wonderful she
was, and how he wanted to tell her so, and would some
day, but must not just yet. He hadn&rsquo;t thought much
about what she was saying&ndash;&ndash;but now it came back&ndash;&ndash;and
he knew that she must have gone here with
her trouble.</p>
<p>He need not have worried about the quarry and the
deep, dark pool. He kept telling himself all the way
up that he need not, but when he reached the top and
came in sight of her he knew it. Knew also that he
had been <i>sure</i> of it all along.</p>
<p>She was sitting on a great fallen log, quietly, calmly,
with her back against an old gnarled branch that rose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
in a convenient way, and her head was thrown back and
up as if she were seeing wonderful visions somewhere
among the green, and the blue and white above. It
was as if she had reached a higher plane where earthly
annoyances do not come, and felt it good to be there.
There was almost a smile on her beautiful lips, a
strong, sweet, wistful smile. She had not been looking
down at the deep, treacherous pool at all. She had been
looking <i>up</i> and her strength had come upon her so.
For one long instant the young man paused and lifted
his hat, watching her in a kind of awe. Her face almost
seemed to shine as if she had been talking with God.
He remembered dimly the story of Moses on the Mount
talking with God. He hesitated almost to intrude upon
a solitude so fine and wonderful. Then in relief and
eagerness he spoke her name:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned and looked at him and her face lit up
with joy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! It is you! Why&ndash;&ndash;how did you happen&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to find you, Jane. Leslie told me everything
and I have hunted everywhere. But when you
were not at college I somehow knew you would be
here. I wanted to find you&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;enfold you, Jane&ndash;&ndash;wrap
you around somehow with my love and care if
you will let me, so that nothing like that can ever hurt
you again. I love you, Jane. I suppose I&rsquo;m a little
previous and all that, being only a kid, as it were, and
neither of us out of college yet, but I shan&rsquo;t change,
and I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I see why it isn&rsquo;t all right for
me to have the right to protect you against such
annoyances as this&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was beside her on the log now, his face burning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
eagerly with deep feeling, one arm protectingly
behind her, the other hand laid strongly, possessively
over the small folded hands in her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;m taking a whole lot for granted,&rdquo; he
said humbly. &ldquo;Perhaps you don&rsquo;t love me&ndash;&ndash;can&rsquo;t even
like me the way I hoped you do. Oh, Jane, speak quick,
and tell me! Darling, can you ever love me enough?
You haven&rsquo;t drawn your hands away! Look up and let
me read your eyes, please&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, she had not drawn her hands away, and she
did not shrink from his supporting arm&ndash;&ndash;and she was
the kind of girl who would not have allowed such
familiarities <i>unless</i>&ndash;&ndash;<i>Ah!</i> She had lifted her eyes and
there was something blindingly beautiful in them, and
tears&ndash;&ndash;great wonderful tears, so sweet and misty that
they made him glad with a thrill of beautiful pain!
Her lips were trembling. He longed to kiss her, yet
knew he must wait until he had her permission&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allison! Listen! You are dear&ndash;&ndash;<i>wonderful</i>&ndash;&ndash;but
you don&rsquo;t know a thing about me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all I want to know, and that is a great deal,
you darling, you!&rdquo; And now he did kiss her, and
drew her close into his arms and would not let her go
even when she struggled gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allison, listen. <i>Listen</i>&ndash;&ndash;please! I must tell
you! <i>Wait&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put her hands against his breast and pushed
herself back away from him where she could look in
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, you <i>must</i> let me go and listen to what I
have to say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you go when you tell me yes or no, Jane.
Do you, can you love me? I must know that first.
Then you shall have your way.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span></div>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s eyes did not falter. She looked at him,
&ldquo;You promised, you know&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Allison&ndash;&ndash;I love you&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;<i>NO!</i> You must
<i>not</i> kiss me again. You must let me go, and listen&ndash;&ndash;You
promised, you know&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison&rsquo;s arms dropped away from her, but his
eyes held her in a long look of joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, darling, go to it&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he said with a
joyous sound in his voice&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I can stand anything now,
I know. It seems too good to be true and it&rsquo;s enough
for me. But hurry! A fellow can&rsquo;t wait forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Allison, you must sit back and be serious.
It isn&rsquo;t really <i>happy</i>, you know&ndash;&ndash;what I have to
tell you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison became grave at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Jane, only I can&rsquo;t imagine anything
terrible enough to stop this happiness of mine unless
you&rsquo;re already married&ndash;&ndash;and have been concealing it
from us all this time&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of herself Jane laughed at that, and Allison
breathed more freely now the tenseness was gone out
of her voice. His hands went out and grasped hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least I can do this,&rdquo; he pleaded, and Jane lifted
her eyes, now serious again, and smiled tenderly, letting
her hands stay in his passively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Allison&ndash;&ndash;my father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Jane, dear&ndash;&ndash;I heard it long ago. Your
father was a forger! What do you suppose I care?
He probably had some overpowering temptation and
yielded, never dreaming but he would be able to make it
right. You can&rsquo;t make me believe that any parent of
<i>yours</i> was actually bad! And besides, if he was, it
wouldn&rsquo;t be <i>you</i>&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allison! Listen!&rdquo; broke in Jane gravely, stopping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
the torrent of words with which he was attempting
to silence her. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t what you think at all. My
father <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> a forger! He was a good man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed Allison joyously. &ldquo;Then
what in thunder? Why didn&rsquo;t you tell &rsquo;em so, Jane?&rdquo;
He tried to draw her to him, but she still resisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it, Allison, I can&rsquo;t. I <i>never</i> can&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then <i>I</i> will! You shan&rsquo;t have a thing like
that hanging over you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is just what you <i>must not do</i>. And you
<i>can&rsquo;t</i> do it, either, if I don&rsquo;t tell you about it, for you
wouldn&rsquo;t have a thing to say, nor any way to prove it.
And I won&rsquo;t tell you, Allison, ever, unless you
will promise&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison was sobered in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane, don&rsquo;t you know me well enough to be sure
I would not betray any confidence you put in me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; said Jane, smiling through
her tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear!&rdquo; said Allison in a tone that was a caress,
full of longing and sympathy.</p>
<p>Jane sat up bravely and began her story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was twelve years old my mother died.
That left father and me alone, and we became very
close comrades indeed. He was a wonderful father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison&rsquo;s fingers answered with a warm pressure of
sympathy and interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was father and mother both to me. And
more and more we grew to confide in one another. I
was interested in all his business, and used to amuse myself
asking him about things at the office when he
came home, the way mother used to do when she was
with us. He used to talk over all my school friends
and interests and we had beautiful times together. My
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
father had a friend&ndash;&ndash;a man who had grown up with
him, lived next door and went to school with him
when he was a boy. He was younger than father, and&ndash;&ndash;well,
not so serious. Father didn&rsquo;t always approve
of what he did and used to urge him to do differently.
He lived in the same suburb with us, and his wife had
been a friend of mother&rsquo;s. She was a sweet little child-like
woman, very pretty, and an invalid. They had
one daughter, a girl about my age, and when we were
children we used to play together, but as we grew older
mother didn&rsquo;t care for us to be together much. She
thought&ndash;&ndash;it was better for us not to&ndash;&ndash;and as the years
went by we didn&rsquo;t have much to do with one another.
Her father was the only one who kept up the acquaintance,
and sometimes I used to think he worried my
father every time he came to the house. One day when
I was about fourteen he came in the afternoon just
after I got home from school and said he wanted to
see father as soon as he came home. Couldn&rsquo;t I telephone
father and ask him to come home at once, that
there was someone there wanting to see him on important
business? He finally called him up himself
and when father got there they went into a room by
themselves and talked until late into the night. When
at last Mr.&ndash;&ndash;that is&ndash;&ndash;the <i>man</i>, went away, father did
not go to bed but walked up and down the floor in
his study all night long. Toward morning I could
not stand it any longer. I knew my father was in
trouble. So I went down to him, and when I saw
him I was terribly frightened. His face was white
and drawn and his eyes burned like coals of fire. He
looked at me with a look that I never shall forget.
He took me in his arms and lifted up my face, a way
he often had when he was in earnest, and he seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
to be looking down into my very soul. &lsquo;Little girl,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;we&rsquo;re in deep trouble. I don&rsquo;t know whether
I&rsquo;ve done right or not.&rsquo; There was something in his
voice that made me tremble all over, and he saw I was
frightened and tried to be calm himself. &lsquo;Janie,&rsquo; he
said&ndash;&ndash;he always called me Janie when he was deeply
moved&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;Janie, it may hit hardest on you, and oh, I
meant your life to be so safe and happy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to tell him it didn&rsquo;t matter about me, and
for him not to be troubled, but he went on telling about
it. It seems the father of this man had once done a
great deal for my father when he was in a very trying
situation, and father always felt an obligation to look
after the son. Indeed, he had promised when the old
man was dying that he would be a brother to him no
matter what happened. And now the son had been
speculating and got deep into debt. He had formed
some kind of stock company, something to do with
Western land and mines. I never fully understood it
all, but there had been a lot of fraudulent dealing,
although father only suspected that at the time, but
anyway, everything was going to fall through and the
man was going to be brought up in disgrace before
the world if somebody didn&rsquo;t help him out. And father
felt obliged to stand by him. Of course, he did not
know how bad it was, because the man had not told
him all the truth, but father had taken over the obligations
of the whole thing. He thought he might be
able to pull the thing out of trouble by putting a good
deal of his own money into it, and make it a fair and
square proposition for all the stockholders without
their ever finding out that everything had been on the
verge of going to pieces. You see the man had put
it up to father very eloquently that his wife was very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
ill in the hospital and, if anything should happen to
him and he were arrested it could not be kept from
her and she would die. It&rsquo;s true she was very critically
ill, had just been through a severe operation, and was
very frail indeed. Father felt it was up to him to
shoulder the whole responsibility, although, of course,
he felt that the man richly deserved the law to the
full. Nevertheless, because of his promise he stood
by him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That night the man was killed in an automobile
accident soon after leaving our house, and when it
developed that the business was built on a rotten foundation,
and that father was in partnership&ndash;&ndash;you see the
man had been very wily and had his papers all fixed up
so that it looked as if father had been a silent partner
from the beginning&ndash;&ndash;everything came back on father,
and he found there were overwhelming debts that he
had not been told about, although he supposed he had
sifted the business to the foundation and understood it
all before he made the agreement to help him. Perhaps
if the man had lived he would have been able to carry
his crooked dealings through and save the whole thing,
with what help father had given him, and neither father
nor the world would ever have found out&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know.&ndash;&ndash;But
anyway, his dying just then made the whole
thing fall in ruins, and right on top of father. But
even that we could have stood. We didn&rsquo;t care so
much about money. Father was well off, and he found
that if he put in everything he could satisfy the creditors,
and pay off everything, and he had courage enough
to be planning to start all over again. But suddenly
it turned out that there had been a check forged for a
large amount and it all looked as if father had done it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
I can&rsquo;t go into the details now, but we were suddenly
face to face with the fact that there was no evidence to
prove that he had not been a hypocrite all these years
except his own life. We thought for a few days that
of course that would put him beyond suspicion&ndash;&ndash;but
do you know, the world is very hard. One of father&rsquo;s
best friends&ndash;&ndash;one he thought was a friend&ndash;&ndash;came to
him and offered to go bail for him for my sake if
he would just tell him the whole truth and own up.
There was only one way and that was to go to the
man&rsquo;s wife and try to get certain papers which father
knew were in existence because he had seen them, and
which he had supposed were left in his own safe the
night the man talked with him, but which could not
be found. As the wife had just been brought back
from the hospital and was still in a very critical condition,
father would not do more than ask if he might
go through the house and search. And that woman
sent back a very indignant refusal, charging father
with having been at the bottom of her husband&rsquo;s failure,
and even the cause of his death, and telling him
he had pauperized her and her little helpless daughter.
And the daughter began treating me as a stranger
whenever we chanced to meet&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison&rsquo;s face darkened and his eyes looked stern
and hard. He said something under his breath angrily.
Jane couldn&rsquo;t catch the words, but he drew her close
in his arms and held her tenderly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And were those papers never found, dear?&rdquo; he
asked after a moment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jane wearily, resting her head back
against his shoulder, &ldquo;I found them, after father died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found them?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I found them slipped down behind the chest
in the hall. It was a heavy oak chest, a great carved
affair that had belonged in the family a long time, and
it was seldom moved. It stood below the hat-rack in the
alcove in the hall, and I figured it out that the man
must have meant to keep those papers himself, so there
would be no incriminating evidence in father&rsquo;s hands,
and that he must have picked them up without father&rsquo;s
noticing and started to carry them home; but that when
he was going away, putting on his overcoat, he had
somehow dropped some of them behind that chest without
knowing it. Because they were not all there&ndash;&ndash;two
of them were missing. Father had described them
to me, and three&ndash;&ndash;the most important ones with the
empty envelope&ndash;&ndash;were found. The other two were
probably larger, and looked like the whole bundle,
which explains how he came to think he had them
all. But the two he had and must have had about
him when he was killed would not in themselves
have been any evidence against him. So, my father
was arrested&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tears choked Jane&rsquo;s voice and suddenly rained
into her sweet eyes as she struggled to recall the whole
sorrowful experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my darling!&rdquo; cried Allison, tenderly holding
her close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father was very brave. He said it was sure to
come out all right, but he wouldn&rsquo;t accept bail, though
it was offered him by several loyal friends. He saw that
they suspected him, and the papers all came out with
big headlines, &lsquo;<span class='smcap'>Church Elder Arrested</span>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison&rsquo;s voice was deep with loving sympathy as
his lips swept her forehead softly and he murmured,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
&ldquo;My poor little girl!&rdquo; but Jane went bravely on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a hard time,&rdquo; she said with trembling
lips, &ldquo;but God was good; he didn&rsquo;t let it last long.
There came an old friend back from abroad who had
known father ever since he was a boy, and who happened
to have been associated with him in business
long enough to give certain proofs that cleared the
whole thing up. In a week the case was dismissed
so far as father was concerned, and he was back at
home again, and restored to the full confidence of his
business associates&ndash;&ndash;that is, those who knew intimately
about the matter. If father had lived I have no doubt
everything would have been all right, and he would
have been able to live down the whole thing, but the
trouble had struck him hard, he was so terribly worried
for my sake, you know. Then he took a little cold
which we didn&rsquo;t think anything about, and suddenly,
before we realized it, he was down with double pneumonia
from which he never rallied. His vitality
seemed to be gone. After he died, the papers said
beautiful things about his bravery and courage and
Christianity, and people tried to be nice, but when it
was all over there were still people who looked at me
curiously when I passed, and whispered noticeably
together; and that man&rsquo;s wife and daughter openly
called me a forger&rsquo;s daughter and said that my father
had stolen their income, when all the time they were
living on what he had given up to save them from disgrace.
The daughter made it so unpleasant for me
that I decided to go away where I was not known,
although I had several dear beautiful homes opened to
me if I had chosen to stay, where I might have been a
daughter and treated as one of the other children.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
But I thought it was better to go away and make my
own life&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you had evidence. Did you never go and tell
those two how wrong they were and how it was their
father, not yours, who was the forger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not exactly,&rdquo; said Jane, lifting clear untroubled
eyes to his face. &ldquo;You see that was part
of father&rsquo;s obligation; it was a point of honor not to
give that man&rsquo;s shame away to his wife&ndash;&ndash;he had promised&ndash;&ndash;and
then, the man, was dead&ndash;&ndash;he could not be
brought to justice; what good would it do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have done the good that those two
women wouldn&rsquo;t have gone around snubbing you and
telling lies about you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, after all, that didn&rsquo;t really hurt me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that brazen girl wouldn&rsquo;t have dared come
here to the same college and make it hot for you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allison! How did you <i>know</i>?&rdquo; Jane sat up and
looked into his eyes, startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew from the first mention that it must have
been Eugenia Frazer. No girl in her senses would
have taken the trouble to do what she did to-day
without some grievance&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;! Oh, that girl! She is
beyond words! Think of anybody ever falling in love
with her! I&rsquo;d like the pleasure of informing her what
her father was. Of course, though, it wasn&rsquo;t her fault.
She couldn&rsquo;t help her father being what he was, but
she could help what she is herself. I should certainly
like to see her get what&rsquo;s coming to her&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Allison&ndash;&ndash;please! It isn&rsquo;t the right spirit
for us to have. Perhaps I&rsquo;d be just like her if I
were in her place&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you being like her&ndash;&ndash;you angel!&rdquo; And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
Allison leaned over again to look into the eyes of
his beloved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dear, we&rsquo;ll get the right spirit about it somehow,
and forget her, but I mean she shall understand
right where she gets off before this thing goes any
farther. No, you needn&rsquo;t protest. I&rsquo;m not going to
give away your confidence. But I&rsquo;m going to settle
that girl where she won&rsquo;t dare to make any more trouble
for you ever again. And the first thing we&rsquo;re going to
do is to announce our engagement. I feel like going
up to the college bulletin board right this minute and
writing it out in great big letters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allison!&rdquo; Jane sat up with shining eyes and her
cheeks very red. Then they both broke down and
laughed, Jane&rsquo;s merriment ending in a serious look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allison, you really <i>want me</i>, now you know what
people may think about my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane, I&rsquo;ve known all that since I first saw you.
Our beloved pastor kindly informed me of it the night
he introduced us, so you see how little weight it had
with any of us. I had no knowledge but that it was
all true, although I couldn&rsquo;t for the life of me see
how a man who was unworthy of you could have possibly
been your father; but it was you, and not your
father, I fell in love with the first night I saw you.
I&rsquo;m mighty glad for your sake that he wasn&rsquo;t that kind
of man, because I know how you would feel about it,
but as for what other people think about it, <i>I should
worry</i>! And Jane, make up your mind right here and
now that we&rsquo;re going to be married the day we both
graduate, see? I won&rsquo;t wait a day longer to have the
right to protect you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall trees whispered above their heads, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
birds looked down and dropped wonderful melodies
about them, and Leslie stormily drove her car
back and forth on the pike and sounded her klaxon
loud and long, but it was almost an hour later that it
suddenly occurred to Allison that Leslie was waiting
for them, and still later before the two with blissful
lingering finally wended their way out to the road and
were taken up by the subdued and weary Leslie, who
greeted them with relief and fell upon her new sister
with eager enthusiasm and genuine delight.</p>
<p>An hour later Allison, after committing his future
bride to the tender ministries of Julia Cloud, who had
received her as a daughter, took his way collegeward.
He sent up his card to Miss Frazer and Miss Brice and
requested that he might see them both as soon as possible,
and in a flutter of expectancy the two presently
entered the reception-room. They were hoping he had
come to take them out in his car, although each was
disappointed to find that she was not the only
one summoned.</p>
<p>Allison in that few minutes of waiting for them,
seemed to have lost his care-free boyish air and have
grown to man&rsquo;s estate. He greeted the two young
women with utmost courtesy and gravity and proceeded
at once to business:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come to inform you,&rdquo; he said with a bow
that might almost be called stately, so much had the
tall, slender figure lost its boyishness, &ldquo;that Miss Bristol
is my fianc&eacute;e, and as such it is my business to protect
her. I must ask you both to publicly apologize before
your sorority for what happened this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eunice Brice grew white and frightened, but
Eugenia Frazer&rsquo;s face flamed angrily.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Allison Cloud, I&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind.
What in the world did you suppose I had to do with
what happened this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had all to do with it. Miss Frazer, I happen
to know all about the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you certainly don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; flamed Eugenia, &ldquo;or
you wouldn&rsquo;t be engaged to that little Bristol hypocrite.
Her father was a common&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison took a step toward her, his face stern
but controlled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her father was <i>not</i> a <i>forger</i>, Miss Frazer, and I
have reason to believe that you know that the report
you are spreading about college is not true. But
however that may be, Miss Frazer, if I should say that
your father was a forger would that change <i>you</i> any?
I have asked Miss Bristol to marry me because of what
<i>she is herself</i>, and not because of what her father was.
But there is ample evidence that her father was a noble
and an upright man and so recognized by the law and
by his fellow-townsmen, and I demand that you take
back your words publicly, both of you, and that you,
Miss Frazer, take upon yourself publicly the responsibility
for starting this whole trouble. I fancy it may
be rather unpleasant for you to remain in this college
longer unless this matter is adjusted satisfactorily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I certainly do not intend to be bullied into
any such thing!&rdquo; said Eugenia angrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave college
first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eunice Brice began to cry. She was the prot&eacute;g&eacute;e
of a rich woman and could not afford to be disgraced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall tell them all that you asked me to make that
motion for you and promised to give me your pink
evening dress if I did,&rdquo; reproached Eunice tearfully.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell what you like,&rdquo; returned Eugenia grandly,
&ldquo;it will only prove you what you are, a little fool!
I&rsquo;m going up to pack. You needn&rsquo;t think you can hush
me up, Allison Cloud, if you <i>are</i> rich. Money won&rsquo;t
cover up the truth&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Allison looking at her steadily, controlledly,
with a memory of his promise to Jane. &ldquo;No,
but <i>Christianity</i> will&ndash;&ndash;sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, everybody knows you&rsquo;re a fanatic!&rdquo;
sneered Eugenia, and swept herself out of the room
with high head, knowing that the wisest thing she could
do was to depart while the going was good.</p>
<p>When Allison reached home a few minutes later
Julia Cloud put into his hand a letter which his guardian
had written her soon after his first visit, in which
he stated that he had made it a point to look up both
the young people with whom his wards were intimate,
and he found their records and their family irreproachable.
He especially went into details concerning Jane&rsquo;s
father and the noble way in which he had acted, and
the completeness with which his name had been cleared.
He uncovered one or two facts which Jane apparently
did not know, and which proved that time had revealed
the true criminal to those most concerned and that only
pity for his family, and the expressed wish of the man
who had borne for a time his shame, had caused the
matter to be hushed up.</p>
<p>Allison, after he had read it, went to find Jane
and drew her into the little sun-parlor to read it with
him, and together they rejoiced quietly.</p>
<p>Jane lifted a shining face to Allison after the
reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m glad we never said anything to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
Eugenia! Poor Eugenia! She is greatly to be pitied!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allison, a little shamefacedly, agreed, and then
owned up that he had &ldquo;fired&rdquo; Eugenia, as he expressed
it, from the college.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Allison!&rdquo; said Jane, half troubled, though
laughing in spite of herself at the vision of Eugenia
trying to be lofty in the face of the facts. &ldquo;You ought
not to have done it, dear. I have stood it so
long, it didn&rsquo;t matter! Only for your sake&ndash;&ndash;and
Leslie&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For our sakes, nothing!&rdquo; said Allison. &ldquo;That
girl needed somebody to tell her where to get off, and
only a man could do it. She&rsquo;ll be more polite to people
hereafter, I&rsquo;m thinking. It won&rsquo;t do her any harm.
Now, Jane darling, forget it, and let&rsquo;s be happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, Allison, some one is coming. I think
it&rsquo;s that Mr. Terrence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dog-gone his fool hide!&rdquo; muttered Allison. &ldquo;I
wish he&rsquo;d take himself home! I certainly would like
to tell <i>him</i> where to get off. Leslie&rsquo;s as sick of him as
I am, and as for Cloudy, she&rsquo;s about reached the limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Allison, isn&rsquo;t Leslie interested in him? He
told Howard that they were as good as engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leslie interested in that little cad? I should say
not. If she was I&rsquo;d disown her. You say he told
Howard they were engaged! What a lie! So that&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s the matter with the old boy, is it? I thought
something must be the matter that he got so busy all
of a sudden. Well, I&rsquo;ll soon fix that! Come on up
to Cloudy&rsquo;s porch, quick, while he&rsquo;s in his room.
Cloudy won&rsquo;t mind. We&rsquo;ll be by ourselves there till
dinner is ready!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
</div>
<p>But matters came to a climax with Howard
Letchworth before Allison had any opportunity
to do any &ldquo;fixing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next afternoon was Class Day and there were
big doings at the college. Howard kept out of the way,
for it was a day on which he had counted much, and
during the winter once or twice he and Leslie had
talked of it as a matter of course that they would be
around together. His Class Day had seemed then to
be of so much importance to her&ndash;&ndash;and now&ndash;&ndash;now she
was going to attend it in Clive Terrence&rsquo;s company!
Terrence had told him so, and there seemed no reason
to doubt his word. She went everywhere with him,
and he was their guest; why shouldn&rsquo;t she? So
Howard went glumly about his duties, keeping as much
as possible out of everyone&rsquo;s way. If he had not been
a part of the order of exercises, and a moving spirit of
the day, as it were, he would certainly have made up
an excuse to absent himself. As it was, he meditated
trying to get some one else to take his place, and was
on his way to arrange it, just before the hour for
the afternoon exercises to begin, when suddenly he
saw, coming up the wide asphalt walk of the campus,
young Terrence, and the girl who had come to be
known among them as the &ldquo;Freshman Vamp.&rdquo; His
eyes hastily scanned the groups about, and searched
the walk as far as he could see it, but nowhere could
he discover Leslie.</p>
<p>With a sudden impulse he dashed over to Julia
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
Cloud, and forgetful of his late estrangement spoke with
much of his old eagerness; albeit trying his best to
appear careless and matter-of-fact:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Leslie hereabouts somewhere, Miss Cloud?
I believe I promised to show her the ivy that our class
is to plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first excuse he could think of. But
Julia Cloud was full of sympathy and understanding,
and only too glad to hear the old
ring of friendliness in his voice. She lowered her tone
and spoke confidentially:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t come, Howard: I don&rsquo;t just know
what has taken her. She said she would rather stay
at home&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she down there now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>will</i>!&rdquo; he said, and was off like a flash. On
his way down the campus he thrust some papers into a
classmate&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t get back in time, give those to Halsted
and tell him to look out for things. I&rsquo;m called away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never in all his running days had he run as he did
that day. He made the station in four minutes where
it usually took him six, and was at the Cloud Villa in
two more, all out of breath but radiant. Something
jubilant had been let loose in his heart by the smile
in Julia Cloud&rsquo;s eyes, utterly unreasonable, of course,
but still it had come, and he was entertaining it royally.
It was rather disheartening to find the front door
locked and only Cherry to respond to his knock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Miss Leslie here?&rdquo; he asked, a blank look
coming into his eyes as Cherry appeared.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Leslie done jes&rsquo; skittered acrost de back
yahd wid a paddle in her han&rsquo;. I reckum she&rsquo;s gone to
de crick. Miss Jewel, she&rsquo;ll be powerful upset ef she
comes back an&rsquo; finds out. She don&rsquo;t like Miss Leslie
go down to them canoes all by her lonesome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Cherry,&rdquo; said Howard, cheering
up; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down and find her. Got an extra paddle
anywhere, or did she take them both?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, she only took de one. Here&rsquo;s t&rsquo;other.
I reckum she&rsquo;ll be right glad to see yeh, Mas&rsquo;r Howard.
We-all hes missed you mighty powerful lot. That
there little fish-eyed lady-man wot is visitin&rsquo; us ain&rsquo;t no
kind of substoote &rsquo;tall fer you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Howard beamed on her silently and was off like
a shot, forgetful of the chimes on the clock of the
college, which were now striking the hour at which he
was to have led the procession down the ivy walk to the
scene of festivities.</p>
<p>Over two fences, across lots, down a steep, rocky
hill, and he was at the little landing where the Cloud
canoe usually anchored. But Leslie and her boat were
gone. No glimpse of bright hair either up or down
stream gave hint of which she had taken, no ripple
in the water even to show where she had passed. But
he knew pretty well her favorite haunts up-stream
where the hemlocks bowed and bent to the water, and
made dark shadows under which to slip. The silence
and the beauty called her as they had always called
him. He was sure he would find her there rather than
down-stream where the crowds of inn people played
around, and the tennis courts overflowed into canoes
and dawdled about with ukeleles and cameras. He
looked about for a means of transport. There was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
only one canoe, well-chained to its rest. He examined
the padlock for a moment, then put forth his strong
young arm and jerked up the rest from its firm setting
in the earth. It was the work of a second to shoot the
boat into the water, fling the chains, boat-rest and all
into the bow, and spring after. Long, strong, steady
strokes, and he shot out into the stream and away up
beyond the willows; around the turn where the chestnut
grove bloomed in good promise for the autumn; beyond
the railroad bridge and the rocks; past the first
dipping hemlocks; around the curve; below the old
camp where they had had so many delightful picnics
and watched the sunset from the rocks; and on, up
above the rapids. The current was swift to-day. He
wondered if Leslie had been able to pass them all alone,
yet somehow he felt she had and he would find her up
in the quiet haven where few ever came and where she
would be undisturbed. Paddling &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; he came
around the curve silently and was almost upon her, but
was unprepared for the little huddled figure down in
the bottom of the boat, one hand grasping the paddle
which was wedged between some stones in the shallow
stream bed to anchor the frail bark, the other arm
curved about as a pillow for the face which was hidden,
with only the bright hair gleaming in the stray rays of
sunshine that crept through the young leaves overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leslie, little girl&ndash;&ndash;my darling&ndash;&ndash;what is the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scarcely knew what he was saying, so anxiously
he watched her. Was she hurt or in trouble, and if so,
what was the trouble? Did the vapid little guest and
the Freshman Vamp have anything to do with it?
Somehow he forgot all about himself now and his own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
grievance&ndash;&ndash;he only wanted to comfort her whom he
loved, and it never entered his head that just at that
moment the anxious Halsted was inquiring of everyone:
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you seen Letchworth? Class Day&rsquo;ll
be a mess without him! Something must have happened
to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie lifted a tear-stained face in startled amaze.
His voice! Those precious words! Leslie heard them
even if <i>he</i> took no cognizance of them himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;<span class='smcap'>well</span>, <span class='smcap'>you</span> ought to know&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo; burst
forth Leslie and then down went the bright head
once more and the slender shoulders shook with long-suppressed
sobs.</p>
<p>It certainly was a good thing that the creek was
shallow at that point and the canoes quite used to all
sorts of conditions. Howard Letchworth waited for
no invitation. He arose and stepped into Leslie&rsquo;s
boat, pinioned his own with a dextrous paddle, and
gave attention to comforting the princess. It somehow
needed no words for awhile, until at last Leslie
lifted a woebegone face that already looked half-appeased
and inquired sobbily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you act so perfectly horrid all
this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; began Howard lamely, wondering
now just why he <i>had</i>&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;! &ldquo;Why, you see, Leslie,
you had company and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Company! <i>That!</i> Now, Howard, you weren&rsquo;t
jealous of that little excuse for a man, were you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Howard colored guiltily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, Leslie, you are so far above
me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was, was I? Well, if I was above <i>you</i>,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
where did you think that other ridiculous little simp
belonged, I should like to know? <i>Not</i> with <i>me</i>,
I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you see, Leslie&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; somehow the great question
that had loomed between them these weeks dwarfed
and shrivelled when he tried to explain it to Leslie&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve just found out you are very rich&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>I&rsquo;m</i> <span class='smcap'>poor</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought you just said you <i>loved</i> me!&rdquo;
flashed Leslie indignantly. &ldquo;If you do, I don&rsquo;t see
what rich and poor matter. It&rsquo;ll all belong to us
both, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should <i>hope</i> not,&rdquo; said the young man, drawing
himself up as much as was consistent with life in a
canoe. &ldquo;I would <i>never</i> let my wife support me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps you might be able to make enough
to <i>support yourself</i>,&rdquo; twinkled Leslie with mischief in
a dimple near her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leslie, now you&rsquo;re making fun! I mean this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want me to do about it, give
away my money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. I was a cad and all that, but
somehow it seemed as though I hadn&rsquo;t any business to
be coming around you when you were so young and
with plenty of chances of men worth more than I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More what? More money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leslie, this is a serious matter with me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is with me, too,&rdquo; said Leslie, suddenly
grave. &ldquo;You certainly have made me most unhappy
for about three weeks. But I&rsquo;m beginning to think
you don&rsquo;t love me after all. What is money between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
people who love each other? Only something that they
can have a good time spending for others, isn&rsquo;t it? And
suppose <i>I</i> should say I wouldn&rsquo;t let <i>you support me</i>?
I guess after all if you think so much of money you
don&rsquo;t really care!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leslie!&rdquo; Their eyes met and his suddenly fell
before her steady, beautiful gaze:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Howard Letchworth, if you are so
awfully proud that you have to be the richest, I&rsquo;ll throw
away or give away all my money and be a pauper,
<i>so there</i>! Then will you be satisfied? What&rsquo;s money
without the one you love, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, Leslie! I was a fool. You darling, wonderful
princess. No, keep your money and I&rsquo;ll try
to make some more and we&rsquo;ll have a wonderful time
helping others with it. I suppose I knew I was a fool
all the time, only I wanted to be told so, because you
see that fellow told me you and he had been set apart
for each other by your parents&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden lurch of the canoe roused him to look at
Leslie&rsquo;s face:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that little&ndash;&ndash;liar! Yes, he is! He is the meanest,
conceitedest, most disagreeable little snob&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there! We&rsquo;ll spare him&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; laughed
Howard. &ldquo;I see I was wrong again, only, Leslie,
little princess, there&rsquo;s one thing you must own is true,
you&rsquo;re very young yet and you may change&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, <i>I like that</i>!&rdquo; cried Leslie. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
even think I have the stability to be true to you. Well,
if I&rsquo;m as weak-looking as that you better go and find
someone else&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he stopped her words with his face against her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
lips, and his arms about her, and at last she nestled
against his shoulder and was at peace.</p>
<p>Chiming out above the notes of the wood-robin and
the thrush there came the faint and distant notes of the
quarter hour striking on the college library. It was
Leslie who heard it. Howard was still too far upon the
heights to think of earthly duties yet awhile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howard! Isn&rsquo;t this your Class Day? And haven&rsquo;t
you a part in the exercises? Why aren&rsquo;t you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned with startled eyes, and rising color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stay, Leslie. I was too miserable! I
had to come after you. You promised to be with me
to-day, you know&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your Class Poem, Howard! Quick! It
must be almost time to read it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took out his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott! I didn&rsquo;t know the time had gone
like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie&rsquo;s fingers were already at work with the other
canoe, tying its chain to the seat of her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; she turned and picked up her paddle
swiftly, handing Howard the other one. &ldquo;Go! For
all your worth! You mustn&rsquo;t fail on this day anyway!
Beat it with all your might!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late!&rdquo; said the man reluctantly, taking
the paddle and moving to his right position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not too late. It <i>shan&rsquo;t</i> be too late! <i>Paddle</i>, I
say, <i>now</i>, <span class='smcap'>one</span>&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;<span class='smcap'>two</span>&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they settled to a rhythmic stroke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was so wonderful back there, Leslie,&rdquo; said
Howard wistfully. &ldquo;We oughtn&rsquo;t to let anything
interfere with this first hour together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t interfering,&rdquo; said Leslie practically,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s just duty, and that never interferes. Here, we&rsquo;ll
land over there and you beat it up the hill! I&rsquo;ll padlock
the boats by that old tree and follow, but <i>don&rsquo;t you
dare</i> wait for me! I&rsquo;ll be there to hear the first word
and they&rsquo;ll have waited for you, I know. A little to
the right, there&ndash;&ndash;<i>now</i>&ndash;&ndash;step out and <i>beat it</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He obeyed her, and presently came panting to the
audience room, with a fine color, and a great light in
his eyes, just as Halsted was slipping down to inquire
of Allison:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where in thunder is Letchworth? Seen him
anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens, man! Hasn&rsquo;t he showed up yet?&rdquo;
cried Allison startled. &ldquo;Where could he be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia Cloud beside him leaned over and quietly drew
their attention to the figure hastening up the aisle.
Halsted hurried back to the platform, and Allison,
relieved, settled once more in his seat. But Julia Cloud
rested not in satisfaction until another figure breathlessly
slipped in with eyes for none but the speaker.</p>
<p>Then into the eyes of Julia Cloud there came a
vision as comes to one who watching the glorious
setting of the sun sees not the regretful close of the
day that is past, but the golden promise of the day that
is to come.</p>
